        "question": "Passage:  The team rallied for a win over the Washington Redskins at FedExField in week 10. Penalties on Washington's defense helped allow a short McNabb to Brian Westbrook touchdown pass on Philadelphia's opening drive. A fumble by L. J. Smith gave Washington the ball inside Eagle territory, and Jason Campbell capitalized with a touchdown pass to James Thrash, the former Eagle. The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20. The Eagles got the ball back with four minutes to play, and Westbrook immediately took a short pass and broke free for a 57-yard touchdown to go ahead 26-25 (the two-point conversion failing again). The defense came up big again, with Mike Patterson sacking Campbell to jar the ball loose, and Trent Cole recovering. Westbrook carried it in from ten yards out to seal the deal. McNabb, who surpassed Ron Jaworski for the most career completions in franchise history (2,090 at game's end), passed for 251 yards and four touchdowns in the 33-25 win.

They won 54 games during the 2004-05 NBA season, their fourth consecutive season of 50 or more wins. During the 2005 NBA Playoffs, they easily defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4-1 and then rallied from a 2-1 deficit to finish off the 2004-05 Indiana Pacers season, 4-2.

One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines.

Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand. The Sri Lankan American number about 12,000 in the U.S. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Many Sri Lankans in Italy have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples, and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Though British Sri Lankans people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Patriots struck first with a Gostkowski 31-yard field goal.  However, the Jets would fire back with running back Kevan Barlow getting a touchdown on a two-yard run.  Gostkowski would get one more field goal for New England, in the form of a 21-yarder.  In the third quarter, New York kicker Mike Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets continued their pursuit, as Pennington completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Cotchery.  The Patriots tried to fight back, as Brady completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Caldwell, following it up with a successful two-point conversion pass to Caldwell.  However, New York's defense managed to bottle up any chance of a New England comeback.   With the loss, the Patriots would lead the Jets by one game in the AFC East at 6-3. Also with the loss, the Patriots' 57-game streak without consecutive losses, which dated back to the 2002 season, was snapped.

This contest seems to have disturbed the peace of Oehlenschl\u00e4gers mind and to have undermined his genius. His talent may be said to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called Helge, published in 1814. The tragedy of Hagbarth og Signe, (1815), showed a distinct falling-off in style.

Their leader Wijerd Jelckama and what was left of the Frisian army were captured in 1523, taken to the city of Leeuwarden and publicly beheaded. Jancko Douwama was also taken prisoner and died in captivity in Vilvoorde.By December 1524, Frisia was firmly in the hands of the Habsburg. It was renamed into the Lordship of Frisia and ruled by a Stadtholder. Henry of the Palatinate, the new Prince-Bishop of Utrecht, was in conflict with his own Utrecht citizens, who invited troops from Guelders to occupy the city. Henry had no choice but to ask Charles of Habsburg for help. The States of Overijssel also asked Charles to liberate their lands from Guelders. Charles of Habsburg demanded a price, namely that they recognized him as Lord, to which they agreed.Schenck van Toutenburg moved his army into Overijssel and Utrecht and easily chased the Guelders troops, who had already become very unpopular amongst the population. On October 20, 1528, Bishop Henry handed over power to Charles of Habsburg.

In 1748, bishop Olsavszky commissioned a Greek master craftsman, named Constantine, to create the iconostasis of the shrine church. He completed the thirteen meter tall and six meter wide work, richly decorated with carvings, in less than eight months. The painters of the earliest pictures are unknown. In 1785, the basilian painter Mih\u00e1ly Spalinszky was entrusted with the creation of the icons of the iconostasis.

In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million. By 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in East Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in West Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork.

It was described in 1649, probably with the remnants of the moat, and was depicted in 1749 as a large, apparently L-shaped building with a central cupola. It appears to have been rebuilt in the third quarter of the 18th century and by the time of Lady (Sarah) Salusbury was a three-storeyed villa with a central canted entrance bay rising the full height of the north front. A lower wing, presumably an addition, ran southward from the east end. In 1789 Humphry Repton landscaped roughly  of demesne grounds and William Wilkins supplied drawings for a Gothic seat. In his Red Book Repton commented favourably on the hilltop site and enhanced the view towards London. The house and 23 acres, increased by 1834 to 53 acres, was occupied by Trotter baronets (1804-36), Lady Trotter (1836-40), Lady (Elizabeth) Salusbury (1840-3), and Charles Hambro (1843-9). The house was extended westward and a semicircular bay was added to the south front in the early 19th century. By 1849 the demesne fell to 27 acres and the house, described in 1816 as being commodious yet having no regularity of architectural character and in 1822 as an elegant seat, three-storeyed. It continued as a gentlemans residence under Mrs. Howard (1850-3), Henry Vallence (1853-6), Mrs. Geach (1856-61), John Coverdale (1862-7), and Thomas Brandon (1867-76), and in 1877 was offered for sale with 52 acres. After remaining empty it was leased as a school, to Margaret Clark (1882-98) and Lucy Soulsby (1898-1915). In 1891 the school added a classroom and dormitory block on the east and later a chapel beyond that. The house continued as a school until 1934 when, described as shabby-looking, it was bought by C. W. B. Simmonds, a builder, and was pulled down to make way for Manor Drive. Question: How many years after Thomas Brandon left the residence was the house offered for sale? ",

This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989.

The perceived stalemate along with British governments hints of a compromise and secret approaches in the early 1990s led republican leaders increasingly to look for a political agreement to end the conflict, with a broadening dissociation of Sinn F\u00e9in from the IRA. Following negotiations with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and secret talks with British civil servants, the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire in 1994 on the understanding that Sinn F\u00e9in would be included in political talks for a settlement. When the British government then demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn F\u00e9in into multiparty talks, the organisation called off its ceasefire in February 1996. The renewed bombings caused severe economic damage, with the 1996 Manchester bombing and the Docklands bombing causing approximately \u00a3800 million in combined damage. After the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.

Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken. When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees. The provinces unemployment rate rose from 8.7 percent in 1976 to 10.4 percent in 1977, remaining above 10 percent for 19 of the last 23 years of the 20th century. The language barrier has also been regarded as a \"soft cap\" for population growth; for instance from 2013 to 2014 while Montreal gained around 43,000 immigrants from other parts of the world it lost 10,000 residents to other provinces.

For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.  The second quarter continued Houston's dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34-0, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.  The Colts scored their first and the only points scored in the second half with a Reggie Wayne touchdown from Collins in the fourth quarter.

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995\u201396 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128\u2013118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995\u201396 Atlanta Hawks season.  Playing Power forward (basketball), he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award. The Lakers had a record of 22\u201310 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback \"a success.\" While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court. Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Johnsons arrival, left the team for several days. He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain.  Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were \"inexcusable.\" Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury. Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53\u201329 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending NBA champion 1995\u201396 Houston Rockets season, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach Del Harris offense.

The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge (Budapest) linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, \u00d3buda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the countrys administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Danube Swabians in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%. Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the \"Jewish Mecca\" or \"Judapest\". In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (Republic of Hungary).

When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors.

On the drive, Chad Pennington converted key third downs to Brad Smith and Tim Dwight, and was soon faced with a 3rd-and-goal at the Bears' 6-yard line. Apparently unable to see an open Laveranues Coles, Pennington lobbed a pass towards Chris Baker that was intercepted by Brian Urlacher. With just under four minutes left in the half, Thomas Jones appeared to fumble and Kerry Rhodes recovered, but Chicago successfully challenged the play, denying the Jets a scoring opportunity. The game was scoreless at halftime. Eric Mangini, apparently remembering the success of his surprise onside kick against Indianapolis in Week 4, decided to open the second half with one. Unfortunately, this one was scooped up by Chicago's Chris Harris. On the Bears' first play, Jones broke off a 19-yard run, and Jones rushed every play on the drive that was capped off by a 20-yard field goal by Robbie Gould. The Jets' next drive ended when Pennington was intercepted by Nathan Vasher in Chicago territory. The Bears' game-breaking score came when Rex Grossman completed a short pass to Mark Bradley. The Jets' Drew Coleman fell down attempting to make the tackle, and Bradley had an open lane to the end zone to extend the Bears' lead to 10-0. The Bears then went into a ball-control offense, and the Jets could not muster anything. Question: How many interceptions did Chad Pennington throw? ",

        "question": "Passage:  The Bears' first away game of the season occurred in Seattle, who led the all-time series 10-6, including the last three regular season games. However, the Bears had won the last game in Seattle in 2009 25-19. The Bears offense, not featuring Jay Cutler nor Alshon Jeffery, faced a defense led by Kam Chancellor, who returned to the Seahawks after a holdout. Without Chancellor for the first two games of the season, the defense had allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116.4. Jeff Joniak believed that to counter the Legion of Boom, the Bears had to balance the rushing and passing attacks, while watching for a blitz that pressured Aaron Rodgers 19 times in week two. On defense, the Bears had to watch for quarterback Russell Wilson, though he had struggled with pressure in the first two games, being sacked a total of eight times. Additionally, the run defense had to be aware of a running game led by Marshawn Lynch; the corps had averaged 121.5 yards per game. On special teams, the Bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver Tyler Lockett, who had scored on a punt return earlier in the season. The Seahawks won the coin toss and kicked off. Before the Bears' first offensive play, they were penalized for delay of game, and eventually punted. After both teams each traded punts once, Seattle's Richard Sherman utilized a trick punt return, similar to one the Bears had utilized with Devin Hester and Johnny Knox in the past, to record a 64-yard return to the Bears' 19-yard line. Seattle eventually scored first with Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal. Five drives (all of which ended in punts for both teams) later, the Seahawks ended the first half with Hauschka's 21-yarder. Prior to the Seahawks' last drive, controversy over the Bears' last punt arose: after Pat O'Donnell punted, the ball started to bounce out of bounds, but it hit Seahawks linebacker Brock Coyle in the leg, making it available to recover, with defensive back Sherrick McManis taking advantage. However, the officials ruled the punt as downed by McManis, which led to John Fox challenging the call, though it stood. The Bears special teams struggles continued in the second half, when Lockett returned the opening kickoff 105 yards for the touchdown. The Seahawks increased the score with another touchdown later in the third quarter via Jimmy Graham's 30-yard touchdown catch from Wilson, followed by 45- and 48-yard field goals by Hauschka in the fourth quarter to make the final score 26-0. The Bears were shut out for the first time in 194 games (a 15-0 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in week 17, 2002), which was then the sixth-longest streak in the league. After three games, the Bears had allowed 105 total points, the most since the 2003 season, when they allowed 111. Additionally, the Bears punted on all ten drives in the game, the first time since the data was first compiled in 1980. Despite the hardships, the defense improved, allowing only one touchdown after allowing five against the Cardinals; additionally, having the game as one of two teams without a sack, the Bears recorded four against Seattle, two each by defensive end Jarvis Jenkins and linebacker Pernell McPhee.

The Indians dominated the American League in 1995, winning 100 of their 144 games (their 100\u201344 record yielded a very high 0.694 winning percentage, which was, at the time, the highest regular season winning percentage in Major League Baseball since 1954, and is, as of 2015, the 12th highest regular season winning percentage in Major League Baseball history since 1900).  Furthermore, in just 144 games, they won the AL Central by 30 games, and they performed the difficult feat of leading their league in both team batting average (0.291) and ERA (3.81).  Thanks to their hitting and bullpen, this Indians team became known around the league for their ability to come back from many deficits, often in dramatic fashion; of their 100 regular season victories, 48 were come-back victories, 27 came in their last at-bat, 8 came by way of \"walk off\" home runs, and 13 were extra-inning victories (they were 13\u20130 in extra-inning games).  After this dominance of the AL in the regular season, the Indians, in the playoffs, swept the 1995 Boston Red Sox season in the opening round, then held off Ken Griffey, Jr. and the red hot 1995 Seattle Mariners season in the 1995 American League Championship Series, before heading into the Series against the Braves.

Lieutenant Malachi Elliott, a graduate of the US Naval Academy, was appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes on 18 June 1917, at which time about 500 enlisted men had been assigned to the Public Works Department. Seeing that the department would need to expand with skilled craftsmen, architects, draftsmen, designers, and other professional and technical people, he began to screen incoming recruits with these skills. Finding many, but not enough, he expanded to recruiting civilians outside of the installation, getting many men willing to join the Navy as petty officers, with the understanding that qualified men could later apply for commissions. This allowed the Public Works Department to grow to nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were organized into the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works), which was essentially the Public Works Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the Public Works Officers exercised technical control. In October 1917, the regiment began building Camp Paul Jones at San Diego. With its completion, on 30 December 1917, the regiment became \"fully operational\" with 1,500 men organized into three battalions. By April 1918, the regiment consisted of 2,400 in five battalions. Men were withdrawn for assignments in the US and abroad. In spring of 1918, 100 men were given special mechanics and ordnance training before being sent to St. Nazaire, France, to assemble 14\"/50 caliber railway gun. Later they would join the gun crews and perform combat duties along the railway lines in proximity to the Empire of Germany lines. The Twelfth Regiment reached its peak strength 5 November 1918; 55 officers and 6,211 enlisted men formed into 11 battalions. However, with the end of the war on Armistice of 11 November 1918, the regiment gradually faded away by the end of 1918.

In the first match of the tournament, Sint Maarten held Grenada to a scoreless draw in the first half which saw two of Sint Maartens starters sustain injuries. It was later revealed that Raymond Wolff had sustained a broken rib before coming off in the first half while fellow-Dutchman Rick De Punder was credited with an own goal. Grenada scored five goals in the second half to secure the 5\u20130 victory. Sint Maarten arrived on Grenada for the 8pm match at 4pm after the funds for the team airfare, paid for by the CFU, did not reach the airline in time and no seats were available. SMSA President Johnny Singh thought that the team would not be able to compete but another flight was arranged in time. The same scenario occurred for the return flight but the team was expected to be home on the Thursday prior to the teams match against USVI on Saturday. Sint Maarten went on to lose the match to USVI 1\u20132, ending the teams qualifying campaign. Sint Maartens only goal was scored by Ramsleii Boelijn.

Buckley also notes that an American survey carried out concluded that 65% of tanks burned out after being penetrated. United States Army research proved that the major reason for this was the stowage of main gun ammunition in the vulnerable sponsons above the tracks.

James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including The Block (basketball) on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the Cleveland sports curse and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3-1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.

        "question": "Passage: Social Securitys benefit formula provides 90% of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) below the first \"bend point\" of $791/month, 32% of AIME between the first and second bend points $791 to $4781/month, and 15% of AIME in excess of the second bend point up to the Ceiling cap of $113,700 in 2013. The low income bias of the benefit calculation means that lower paid worker receives a much higher percentage of his or her salary in benefit payments than higher paid workers. Indeed, a married low salaried worker can receive over 100% of their salary in benefits after retiring at the full retirement age. High-salaried workers receive 43% or less of their salary in benefits despite having paid into the \"system\" at the same rate\u2014(see benefit calculations above.) To minimize the impact of Social Security taxes on low salaried workers the Earned Income Tax Credit\" and the Child Care Tax Credit were passed, which largely refund the FICA and or SECA payments of low-salaried workers through the income tax system. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0-20%) and second quintile (21-40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average federal income tax of \u22129.3% and \u22122.6% of income and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% of income respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average total federal tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively. However, these groups also have by far the smallest percentage of American household incomes - the first quintile earns just 3.2% of all income, while the second quintile earns only 8.4% of all income.

Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC, Dadiwan culture from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC.

In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d\u00e9tat attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 - there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union was in the middle of an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time Boris Yeltsin became Russias new hope, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullahs government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze \"I didnt want to be president, you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you are throwing me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate.\" Question: How many more tribal men were there than regular troops? ",

        "question": "Passage: Digital distribution of movies has the potential to save money for film distributors.  To print an 80-minute feature film can cost US$1,500 to $2,500, so making thousands of prints for a wide-release movie can cost millions of dollars. In contrast, at the maximum 250 megabit-per-second data rate (as defined by Digital Cinema Initiatives for digital cinema), a feature-length movie can be stored on an Commercial off-the-shelf 300 Gigabyte hard drive for $50 and a broad release of 4000 digital prints might cost $200,000. In addition hard drives can be returned to distributors for reuse. With several hundred movies distributed every year, the industry saves billions of dollars. The digital-cinema roll-out was stalled by the slow pace at which exhibitors acquired digital projectors, since the savings would be seen not by themselves but by distribution companies. The Virtual Print Fee model was created to address this by passing some of the saving on to the cinemas. As a consequence of the rapid conversion to digital projection, the number of theatrical releases exhibited on film is dwindling. As of 4 May 2014, 37,711 screens (out of a total of 40,048 screens) in the United States have been converted to digital, 3,013 screens in Canada have been converted, and 79,043 screens internationally have been converted.

At one point the company was selling as many computers as the rest of the industry combined. Its prices for the VIC-20 and 64 were $50 lower than Ataris prices for the 600XL and 800XL.

Its vertical integration and Tramiels focus on cost control helped Commodore do well during the price war, with $1 billion in 1983 sales.

The Jets had lost their opener to the Baltimore Ravens the previous week. The Patriots droved 51 yards in seven-and-a-half minutes to the Jets 14, but after a false-start penalty, Gostkowski missed a 37-yard field goal. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots went on a 15 play, 75-yard marathon, taking over eight minutes off the clock, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Welker early in the second quarter. After accruing no passing yards during the first quarter, the Jets marched 73 yards in 12 plays, taking just under 7 minutes off the clock, scoring on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Braylon Edwards. Two possessions later, after two incomplete passes, Brady hit Hernandez for a 46-yard catch-and-run, then hit Moss for a 34-yard touchdown pass on an incredible one-handed catch, beating the vaunted Darrelle Revis, re-taking a 14-7 lead. The Jets answered, marching to the Patriots 31, and Nick Folk  was good on a 49-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 14-10 at halftime. After a Jets punt, the Patriots drove to the Jets 47, but Antonio Cromartie intercepted his pass attempt for Moss at the 3. The Jets raced to the Patriots 17, and Folk was good on a 36-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 14-13. The Jets cashed in after a Patriots three-and-out, racing 70 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery (with a successful 2-point conversion), taking a 21-14 lead. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Cromartie intercepted another pass attempt for Moss at the Jets 41, but couldn't move the ball. After forcing the Patriots to punt, the Jets marched 63 yards in 8 plays, aided by a 23-yard pass interference penalty on Darius Butler, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown toss to Dustin Keller, widening the lead to 28-14 midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots drove to the Jets 16, but Brady was strip-sacked by Jason Taylor with David Harris  returning it 16 yards to the Jets 41. A 3-yard run by LaDanian Tomlinson on 4th-and-1 allowed the Jets ran out the rest of the clock to win the game. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 1-1.

Self-reported West Indian American, mostly from Jamaica and Haiti, represented 0.9% of the US population, at 2.6 million. Self-reported black immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also represented 0.9%, at about 2.8 million. Additionally, self-identified Black Hispanic and Latino Americans represented 0.4% of the United States population, at about 1.2 million people, largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities. Self-reported black immigrants hailing from other countries in the Americas, such as Brazil and Canada, as well as several European countries, represented less than 0.1% of the population. Mixed-Race Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans who identified as being part black, represented 0.9% of the population. Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were \"native black American\" or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves.

However, according to the U.S. census bureau, evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as \"Black, African Am., or Negro\". Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the \"Some Other Race\" write-in entry.

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995\u201396 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128\u2013118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995\u201396 Atlanta Hawks season.  Playing Power forward (basketball), he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award. The Lakers had a record of 22\u201310 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback \"a success.\" While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court. Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Johnsons arrival, left the team for several days. He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain.  Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were \"inexcusable.\" Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury. Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53\u201329 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending NBA champion 1995\u201396 Houston Rockets season, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach Del Harris offense. Johnson led the way to a Game 2 victory with 26 points, but averaged only 7.5 points per game for the remainder of the series, which the Rockets won three games to one.

        "question": "Passage: In 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million. During the period of economic prosperity that was dubbed by economists as the \"Mexican Miracle\", the government invested in efficient social programs that reduced the infant mortality rate and increased life expectancy. These measures jointly led to an intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980. The populations annual growth rate has been reduced from a 3.5% peak in 1965 to 0.99% in 2005. While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of demographic transition, close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger. Fertility rates have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006. The average annual population growth rate of the capital, the Mexico City, was the first   in the country at 0.2%. The state with the lowest population growth rate over the same period was Michoac\u00e1n (-0.1%), whereas the states with the highest population growth rates were Quintana Roo (4.7%) and Baja California Sur (3.4%), both of which are two of the least populous states and the last to be admitted to the Union in the 1970s. The average annual net migration rate of the Federal District over the same period was negative and the lowest of all political divisions of Mexico, whereas the states with the highest net migration rate were Quintana Roo (2.7), Baja California (1.8) and Baja California Sur (1.6). While the national annual growth rate was still positive (1.0%) in the early years of the 2000s, the national net migration rate was negative (-4.75/1000 inhabitants), given the former strong flow of immigrants to the United States; an estimated 5.3 million undocumented Mexicans lived in the United States in 2004 and 18.2 million American citizens in the 2000 Census declared having Mexican ancestry. However, as of recent years in the 2010s, the net migration rate reached 0, given the strong economy of Mexico and a weakening American economy, causing many of its former residents to return. However, Mexico is the second country in the total number of immigrants to the United States from 1830 to 2000, after Germany.

Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use.

Gladstone had to increase expenditure on the military and a vote of credit of \u00a31,250,000 was taken to send a force of 25,000 to the East. The deficit for the year would be \u00a32,840,000 (estimated revenue \u00a356,680,000; estimated expenditure \u00a359,420,000). Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased income tax by half, from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (from \u22482.92% to \u22484.38%). He proclaimed that \"the expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose on the ambition and the lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations\". By May \u00a36,870,000 was needed to finance the war and introducing another budget on 8 May, Gladstone raised income tax from tenpence halfpenny to fourteen pence in the pound to raise \u00a33,250,000.

The third contract was a \u00a31.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2002 to 2003\u201304.

According to the CIA World Factbook, U.S. income inequality ranked 41st highest among 156 countries in 2017 (i.e., 74% of countries have a more equal income distribution). According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 1% of income households earned about a 9% share of the pre-tax income in 1979, versus 19% in 2007 and 17% in 2014. For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the Great Recession, and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the Affordable Care Act). Recasting the 2012 income using the 1979 income distribution (representing the more egalitarian 1950-1980 period), the bottom 99% of families would have averaged about $7,100 more income.

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995\u201396 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128\u2013118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995\u201396 Atlanta Hawks season.  Playing Power forward (basketball), he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award. The Lakers had a record of 22\u201310 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback \"a success.\" While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court. Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Johnsons arrival, left the team for several days. He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain.  Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were \"inexcusable.\" Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury. Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53\u201329 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending NBA champion 1995\u201396 Houston Rockets season, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach Del Harris offense. Johnson led the way to a Game 2 victory with 26 points, but averaged only 7.5 points per game for the remainder of the series, which the Rockets won three games to one.

Various schools of Buddhism (a religion from India) flourished as represented by the Chinese Ch\u00e1n (or Zen) beliefs of Wang Wei (Tang dynasty) (701-761). His quatrains (jueju) describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line. Tang poetrys big star is Li Bai (701-762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse (Gushi (poetry)) as well as the tonally regulated new style verse (Regulated verse). Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712-770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it. A parade of great Tang poets also includes Chen Ziang (661-702), Wang Zhihuan (688-742), Meng Haoran (689-740), Bai Juyi (772-846), Li He (790-816), Du Mu (803-852), Wen Tingyun (812-870), (listed chronologically) and Li Shangyin (813-858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure, and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu, now ranked alongside Li Bai.

The current, FY 2014 funding of $215m did not keep up with CFTCs increasing swaps market oversight and regulation, equivalent to tens of trillions of dollars in formerly dark market trading, according to outgoing Commissioner Bart Chilton in his last speech. The Obama administrations latest budget proposal for FY 2015 requested $280m, which is $35m less than the request for the previous year, and would fund \"100 less employees than we need\" per Chilton, who called the budget \"woefully insufficient\" for CFTCs more than 40-fold increased purview. In February 2014, Commissioner Scott D. OMalia dissented from the FY 2014 spending plan saying that it did not allocate enough funding to new technology investments, but allocated too much to swap dealer oversight, duplicating the work of the self-regulatory National Futures Association. In March he dissented from the FY 2015 budget request stating CFTC \"makes an unrealistic request for new staff and funding in this budget request without a firm understanding of its mission priorities, specific goals, and corresponding personnel and technology needs.\" Question: How many more million dollars was the CFTCs budget in 2008 than in 2007?

Five of them were decided Per curiam decision. 38 out of the 78 decisions (representing 49% of the decisions) were unanimous in judgement, with 24 decisions being completely unanimous (a single opinion with every justice that participated joining it). This was the largest percentage of unanimous decisions that the Court had in ten years, since the October 2002 term (when 51% of the decisions handed down were unanimous). The Court split 5-4 in 23 cases (29% of the total); of these, 16 broke down along the traditionally perceived ideological lines, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on one side, Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan on the other, and Justice Kennedy holding the balance. Of these 16 cases, Justice Kennedy sided with the conservatives on 10 cases, and with the liberals on 6. Three cases were decided by an interesting alignment of justices, with Chief Justice Roberts joined by Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer and Alito in the majority, with Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority.

One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines.

After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive to the Patriots 33, but went for it on 4th-and-1 instead of kicking the field goal and Bernard Pierce was tackled for a loss. The Ravens forced a punt and Flacco engineered a 92-yard  touchdown drive to trim the lead to 30-28 with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Smith. On the Patriots ensuing possession, Brady was intercepted by Ladarius Webb, but Webb was flagged for illegal contact and the Patriots retained possession. They reached the Ravens 44, but on 2nd-and-9, Brady was sacked for a 7-yard loss moving the ball back to the Patriots 49, and his 3rd-down pass was incomplete, forcing a punt. Taking over at their own 21 with 1:55 to go, Flacco hit Jacoby Jones for a 24-yard gain. Baltimore was able to reach the Patriots 34 where Flacco threw an incompletion on 3rd-and-9, but Devin McCourty was flagged for pass interference, moving the ball to the 7-yard line. Justin Tucker kicked a field goal that appeared to miss wide right, but was controversially ruled good and the Ravens won 31-30. With this loss New England fell to 1-2. The Ravens not only avenged the AFC Championship defeat by winning their first-ever regular season meeting against their opponent, but the Patriots faced their first sub-.500 record in 145 games since starting the 2003 season 0-1 against the Buffalo Bills, and also stumbled to their first 1-2 start since 2001.

Washington continued an old tradition of playing its arch-rival Cowboys in the first week of the season. Both teams were unimpressive and the Redskins offense sputtered throughout the game, but they finally won 13-10 after a touchdown pass by Tony Romo was nullified after a holding call. They hosted the Texans in Week 2, but good all-around offensive performance (especially by McNabb, who passed for 426 yards and a touchdown) failed to secure a win. The game tied at 27-27 and went into overtime where Houston kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard FG, ending the match at 30-27. After this, the Redskins lost to St. Louis 30-16 before McNabbs return to Philadelphia. Although Washington did not deliver a particularly strong performance, they won 16-12 after Eagles QB Michael Vick was injured and replaced by Kevin Kolb. In Week 5, they hosted Green Bay for only the second time since 1979 (the first was in 2004) and beat them 16-13. After losing a Sunday Night match to the Colts, Washington beat Chicago in Week 7. Although McNabb threw two interceptions, the team took advantage of their opponents porous O-line to sack and pick off Jay Cutler (American football) four times, winning 17-14. After losing a 37-25 trap game in Detroit, the Redskins went on their bye week and returned to host Philadelphia on MNF for the second straight year. As rain fell on Fedex Field, the Eagles proceeded to crush Washington 59-28 with eight touchdowns. In contrast to the huge numbers put up by Michael Vick, McNabb looked decidedly unimpressive, with two touchdown passes and three interceptions (one returned for a TD). Just before the game, he had finalized his contract with the Redskins, who gave him a 5-year, $78 million deal and allowing him to (barring unforeseen circumstances) finish out his career in Washington. After beating Tennessee, the Redskins lost four straight games and were removed from playoff contention before beating Jacksonville in Week 16.

To print an 80-minute feature film can cost US$1,500 to $2,500, so making thousands of prints for a wide-release movie can cost millions of dollars. In contrast, at the maximum 250 megabit-per-second data rate (as defined by Digital Cinema Initiatives for digital cinema), a feature-length movie can be stored on an Commercial off-the-shelf 300 Gigabyte hard drive for $50 and a broad release of 4000 digital prints might cost $200,000. In addition hard drives can be returned to distributors for reuse. With several hundred movies distributed every year, the industry saves billions of dollars. The digital-cinema roll-out was stalled by the slow pace at which exhibitors acquired digital projectors, since the savings would be seen not by themselves but by distribution companies.

His quatrains (jueju) describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line. Tang poetrys big star is Li Bai (701-762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse (Gushi (poetry)) as well as the tonally regulated new style verse (Regulated verse). Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712-770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it.

Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly.  The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional Urban area of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilization soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted Local council (Israel) status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4.

He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions there and is the only Seabee ever to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Those Seabee \"Civic Action Teams\" continued throughout the Vietnam War and often were fending off enemy forces alongside their Marine and Army counterparts. Teams typically built schools, clinics or drilled wells. In 1964 ACB 1 was the first CB in the theatre. Beginning in 1965 Naval Construction Regiments (NCRs) deployed throughout Vietnam. The Seabees supported the Marines by building a staggering number of aircraft-support facilities, roads, and bridges. Seabees also worked with and taught construction skills to the Vietnamese people. In 1968 the Marine Corps requested that the Navy make a name change to the CBs. The Marines were using \"MCB\" for Marine Corps Base and the Navy was using \"MCB\" for Mobile Construction Battalions. The Navy then added \"Naval\" to MCB creating the NMCBs that now exist. In May 1968 two reserve battalions were activated (RNMCBs 12 and 22) which brought the total number of battalions rotating to Vietnam to 21 (not including ACBs 1 and 2 or the two Construction Battalion Maintenance Units (CBMUs) that were there too).

Stocks rose to 2.6 million ounces (81 t) in 1866, declined in 1875 to 1.6 million ounces (50 t) and rose to 2.5 million ounces (78 t) in 1878. Net exports did not mirror that pattern. In the decade before the Civil War net exports were roughly constant; postwar they varied erratically around pre-war levels, but fell significantly in 1877 and became negative in 1878 and 1879. The net import of gold meant that the foreign demand for American currency to purchase goods, services, and investments exceeded the corresponding American demands for foreign currencies. In the final years of the greenback period (1862-1879), gold production increased while gold exports decreased.  The decrease in gold exports was considered by some to be a result of changing monetary conditions. The demands for gold during this period were as a speculative vehicle, and for its primary use in the foreign exchange markets financing international trade. The major effect of the increase in gold demand by the public and Treasury was to reduce exports of gold and increase the Greenback price of gold relative to purchasing power.

According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population.

Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahmss arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms), (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46\u201349). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (cantata) (1863\u20131868), his Two String Quartets, Op. 51 (Brahms) Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865\u20131873), the third piano quartet (1855\u20131875), and most notably his Symphony No. 1 (Brahms) which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.

The game was played in a driving rainstorm as both teams struggled to move the ball early. With 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Mike Nugent was ready to attempt a 34-yard field goal, but holder Ben Graham could not handle the snap in the slippery conditions, and the Jets were denied. It was the second straight week Graham had flubbed a snap, but this one could be blamed on the wet conditions. The two teams would trade punts for the rest of the half. In the third quarter, Dolphins coach Nick Saban inserted backup quarterback Cleo Lemon into the game, replacing an ineffective Joey Harrington. Finally, the Jets went on a drive with 6:15 left in the third quarter, with Chad Pennington scrambling for 15 yards and moving into the Dolphins' red zone when Yeremiah Bell was flagged for pass interference. Nugent knocked in a 22-yard field goal for the first points of the game. But Lemon rallied Miami, completing two long passes to Randy McMichael and Ronnie Brown picking up a long run before Lemon tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to McMichael, and the Dolphins led 7-3 with 13:26 left in the game. Pennington showed poise in leading the Jets back to take the lead, completing key passes to Brad Smith and Leon Washington before finding Cotchery on a 31-yard completion to the Miami 1-yard line, but the Jets challenged, saying that Cotchery was brought down after he broke the plane of the end zone, and the referee agreed, giving the Jets a 10-7 lead with 8:04 remaining in the game. Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line. Lemon led Miami downfield, completing key passes to Derek Hagan and Sammy Morris before Mare tied the game with a 25-yard field goal. With 2:09 to play, the Jets' biggest play of the season took place. Pennington flipped a short screen pass to Washington, who found a hole and scampered 64 yards down to the Miami 16-yard line.

The Raiders answered in the second quarter as quarterback Jason Campbell found fullback Marcel Reece on a 3-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 37-yard, a 21-yard, and an NFL record tying 63-yard field goal from kicker Sebastian Janikowski. Janikowski's leg helped put the Raiders up 16-3 at halftime. Denver answered in the third quarter as wide receiver Eric Decker returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown, followed by Prater getting a 30-yard field goal. Oakland struck back in the fourth quarter with Campbell's 1-yard touchdown.  The Broncos tried to rally with quarterback Kyle Orton completing a 9-yard touchdown pass to running back Lance Ball, yet the Raiders' offense was able to run out the clock.

After a scoreless first half, which included Bears' defensive end Julius Peppers blocking a 28-yard field goal attempt by kicker Matt Prater in the second quarter, the Bears grabbed the lead in the third quarter, with running back Marion Barber rushing for a 9-yard touchdown. The Bears extended their lead to 10-0 early in the fourth quarter, with a 57-yard field goal by kicker Robbie Gould. With 4:34 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Broncos put together a 7-play, 63-yard drive, and finally got on the scoreboard with 2:08 remaining, when quarterback Tim Tebow threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. With no timeouts remaining, the Broncos tried an onside kick, but Chicago recovered prior to the two-minute warning. After one running play, the two-minute warning stopped the clock. On the next play, Broncos' linebacker D. J. Williams was able to push Barber out of bounds, saving 40 seconds of time. The Bears eventually punted to the Broncos' 20-yard line with 56 seconds remaining. Tebow subsequently led the Broncos on an 8-play, 39-yard drive, with Prater nailing a game-tying 59-yard field goal to send the game to overtime. This was the first game in NFL history that had two field goals of 57 yards or more. Chicago won the overtime coin toss, however, they deferred, and the Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession. The Bears drove into field goal range on their first overtime possesstion, but Broncos' linebacker Wesley Woodyard forced a fumble off Barber, with defensive end Elvis Dumervil recovering the fumble. Nine plays later, Prater nailed the game-winning 51-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter and overtime, Tim Tebow was 18 of 24 with 191 yards passing and one touchdown.

The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375 million for the American broadcast rights of the 1998 Winter Olympics, while NBC spent US$3.5 billion for the American rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.

According to a 1993 study of archival Soviet data, a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953. However, taking into account the fact that it was common practice to release prisoners who were either suffering from incurable diseases or near death, a combined statistics on mortality in the camps and mortality caused by the camps gives  a probable figure around 1.6 million. In her recent study, Golfo Alexopoulos made an attempt to challenge this consensus figure by encompassing those whose life was shortened due to GULAG conditions.

Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahmss arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms), (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46\u201349). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (cantata) (1863\u20131868), his Two String Quartets, Op. 51 (Brahms) Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865\u20131873), the third piano quartet (1855\u20131875), and most notably his Symphony No. 1 (Brahms) which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.

He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop to ever lead the league in homers, and was just the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidts mark of 48 in 1980.

For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the Great Recession, and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the Affordable Care Act).

Steelers starting QB Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss to the Chiefs did not start, and was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball. The ball was kicked 20 yards towards the Steelers endzone by a Pittsburgh player, but recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession, things were looking bad when the offense was facing a 3rd and 22 with around 3 minutes left. Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17 yards, leaving John Harbaugh with a critical decision. Harbaugh opted to go for it, and Joe Flacco found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10-yard line with less than 2 minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. A very good punt return into Steeler territory by Chris Carr was wiped off by a block in the back. Despite the setback, the Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40-yard line, where their drive stalled. On 3rd and 9 with 25 seconds left, Joe Flacco was sacked and fumbled, but the ball was recovered by Ben Grubbs. With the clock counting inside 10 seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56 yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2 yards short. In overtime, the Steelers won the toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40-yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26 yards to the Steeler 28-yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11-yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With the win, both teams' records is 6-5.

In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long (basketball), Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the Continental Basketball Association. In the final game of the CBA series, Magic Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126-121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry. By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55-0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November, 2001. Magic, at the age of 42, played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State Spartans mens basketball. Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, this was Johnsons first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points. Johnsons half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short. On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State.

The Braves were once again skippered by Bobby Cox, now in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since 2000 Atlanta Braves season when they won 16 in a row. On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August. The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005 Atlanta Braves season. On July 13, 2010 at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim, Braves catcher Brian McCann (baseball) was awarded the MLB All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996 MLB All-Star Game. He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since Fred McGriff did so in 1994. The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (shortstop, born 1977), Rick Ankiel and Kyle Farnsworth from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals, giving up shortstop Yunel Escobar, pitchers Jo-Jo Reyes and Jesse Chavez, outfielder Gregor Blanco and three minor leaguers. On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman Derrek Lee from the Chicago Cubs. On August 22, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs, Mike Minor (baseball) struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record. The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card. They lost to the 2010 San Francisco Giants season in the 2010 National League Division Series in four games. Every game of the series was determined by one run.

The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000\u2013115,000 by 1992; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska, with about 40,000\u201350,000, with the next highest population the Provinces and territories of Canada of British Columbia with 20,000\u201330,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the Contiguous United States with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Floridas most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980.  That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests.

It is the result of a merger of the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island (Allinge-Gudhjem Municipality, Hasle, Bornholm, Nex\u00f8, R\u00f8nne and Aakirkeby) and the former Bornholm County. Bornholm Regional Municipality was also a county in its own right during its first four years from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2006. From 1 January 2007 all counties were abolished, and Bornholm became part of the Capital Region of Denmark whose main responsibility is the health service. The municipality still retains its name Bornholm Regional Municipality. The island had 21 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 15 parishes. In addition to supervising parish municipalities, which was the responsibility of the counties in all of Denmark, the market town municipalities of Bornholm were supervised by Bornholm County as well and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the islands main town, R\u00f8nne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. The question on the ballot was, \"Do you want the six municipal entities of Bornholm to be joined to form one municipal entity as of 1 January 2003?\" 73.9% voted in favour. The lowest percentage for the merger was in Nex\u00f8 municipality, whose mayor, Annelise Molin, a Social Democrat, spoke out against the merger. It was required that each municipality had more \"Yes\" votes than \"No\" votes. Otherwise the merger would have to be abandoned altogether. The six municipal entities had 122 councillors (of which county clls were 15) and the new regional municipality would have 27 councillors from the start. They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018 (Danish local elections, 2017). The merger was approved in a law by the Folketing 19 March 2002, transferring the tasks of the abolished county and old municipalities to the new Bornholm Regional Municipality. The first regional mayor in the first three years from 2003 until 2005 was Thomas Thors (born 28 July 1949), a physician and member of the Social Democrats (Denmark) and previously the last mayor of R\u00f8nne Municipality for five years from 1998 until 2002. Bjarne Kristiansen, who was the last mayor of Hasle, Bornholm 2\u00bd years from the summer of 2000 until 2002, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor for four years from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2007, Bornholm became a part of the Capital Region of Denmark.

In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375 million for the American broadcast rights of the 1998 Winter Olympics, while NBC spent US$3.5 billion for the American rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.

In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long (basketball), Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the Continental Basketball Association. In the final game of the CBA series, Magic Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126-121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry. By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55-0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November, 2001. Magic, at the age of 42, played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State Spartans mens basketball. Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, this was Johnsons first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points. Johnsons half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short. On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 1% of income households earned about a 9% share of the pre-tax income in 1979, versus 19% in 2007 and 17% in 2014. For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the Great Recession, and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the Affordable Care Act).

This funding is almost eight times the amount of financial support Yemen received under the IMFs PRGF. However, in December 2005 the World Bank announced that because of the governments continued inability to effect significant economic reforms and stem corruption, funding would be reduced by more than one-third, from US$420 million to US$240 million for the period July 2005 \u2013 July 2008. In May 2006, the World Bank adopted a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Yemen for the period FY 2006 to FY 2009, providing a blueprint for fostering the countrys fiscal and human development improvement. The bank pledged to contribute approximately US$400 million in International Development Association (IDA) credits over the CAS time frame. At present, Yemen owes approximately US$264 million to Japan, one of its largest donors. In December 2005, the Government of Japan pledged to write off US$17 million of the debt. That same month, Germany pledged to increase its annual aid to Yemen to US$83.6 million over the next two years; funding will go primarily to education and water improvement projects.

Du Camp had witnessed the last days of the Commune, went inside the Tuileries Palace shortly after the fires were put out, witnessed the executions of Communards by soldiers, and the bodies in the streets. He studied the question of the number of dead, and studied the records of the office of inspection of the Paris cemeteries, which was in charge of burying the dead. Based on their records, he reported that between 20 and 30 May, 5,339 corpses of Communards had been taken from the streets or Paris morgue to the city cemeteries for burial. Between 24 May and 6 September, the office of inspection of cemeteries reported that an additional 1,328 corpses were exhumed from temporary graves at 48 sites, including 754 corpses inside the old quarries near Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, for a total of 6,667. Modern Marxist critics attacked du Camp and his book; Collette Wilson called it \"a key text in the construction and promulgation of the reactionary memory of the Commune\" and Paul Lidsky called it \"the bible of the anti-Communard literature.\" In 2012, however, historian Robert Tombs made a new study of the Paris cemetery records and placed the number killed between 6,000 and 7,000, confirming du Camps research. Jacques Rougerie, who had earlier accepted the 20,000 figure, wrote in 2014, \"the number ten thousand victims seems today the most plausible; it remains an enormous number for the time.\" Question: How many corpses were not from the old quarries near Parc des Buttes-Chaumont?

Things started off well as the Giants drove right down the field on their opening possession. The balanced, well-executed seven-minute drive was capped off by a 4-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The extra point was missed by Lawrence Tynes. On their next possession, the Giants were driving for more, but a tipped ball resulted in an interception inside the red zone. The 49ers responded with a nice drive of their own, aided by a personal foul on linebacker Antonio Pierce and several third down conversions.  San Francisco cashed in with a touchdown from Trent Dilfer to Arnaz Battle. Following a Frank Gore fumble, the Giants took control. The running game, which accounted for 140 total yards helped the Giants move back in front. Brandon Jacobs scored on a five-yard run for a 13-7 lead. After an interception by Sam Madison, the Giants added a 30-yard field goal by Tynes. Tynes made it 19-7 at the half with another field goal, this time from 39 yards, inside the final minute. The Giants defense dominated in the second half, notching six sacks and four total turnovers. Osi Umenyiora put the game away with a sack, forced fumble, and 75-yard touchdown return up the field for a 26-7 lead. The Niners got two points back on a blocked punt out of the end zone but Antonio Pierce redeemed himself for two earlier personal fouls by intercepting Trent Dilfer and returning the ball inside the 10. After a flag on the 49ers, Manning threw his second touchdown, this time to Jeremy Shockey for a 33-9 lead. The 49ers scored late to provide the final points in the 33-15 win.

The C\u00f4te-de-Bretagne red spinel was then among the 8 main jewels. They suffered important loss by the Catholic League (French) in 1590 but were reconstituted by Henry IV of France and greatly enhanced by Louis XIV of France, notably with the gift of the 18 Cardinal Mazarin diamonds and the purchase of the Tavernier Blue and Ruspoli Sapphire, later followed in 1717 with the Regent Diamond. Under Louis XV of France, they were kept in the Garde Meuble de la Couronne (Royal Treasury) in one of the pavilions of the Place de la Concorde, where they suffered a theft in 1792 and a sale in 1795 after their partial recovery. In 1814, Napoleon I of France had restored the crown jewels to 65,072 stones and pearls, not including the personal jewels of both Empress Josephine and Empress Marie-Louise.

        "question": "Passage:  The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive to the Patriots 33, but went for it on 4th-and-1 instead of kicking the field goal and Bernard Pierce was tackled for a loss. The Ravens forced a punt and Flacco engineered a 92-yard  touchdown drive to trim the lead to 30-28 with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Smith. On the Patriots ensuing possession, Brady was intercepted by Ladarius Webb, but Webb was flagged for illegal contact and the Patriots retained possession. They reached the Ravens 44, but on 2nd-and-9, Brady was sacked for a 7-yard loss moving the ball back to the Patriots 49, and his 3rd-down pass was incomplete, forcing a punt. Taking over at their own 21 with 1:55 to go, Flacco hit Jacoby Jones for a 24-yard gain. Baltimore was able to reach the Patriots 34 where Flacco threw an incompletion on 3rd-and-9, but Devin McCourty was flagged for pass interference, moving the ball to the 7-yard line. Justin Tucker kicked a field goal that appeared to miss wide right, but was controversially ruled good and the Ravens won 31-30. With this loss New England fell to 1-2. The Ravens not only avenged the AFC Championship defeat by winning their first-ever regular season meeting against their opponent, but the Patriots faced their first sub-.500 record in 145 games since starting the 2003 season 0-1 against the Buffalo Bills, and also stumbled to their first 1-2 start since 2001. This was the fourth time in the previous ten seasons the Pats had lost consecutive games.  Also, in what turned out to be the replacement officials' next-to-last game officiating, the game was marred by a series of questionable calls that eventually provoked the Ravens fans to start chanting derogatory words towards the referees; Patriots coach Bill Belichick was seen to try to grab one of the officials as they were scurrying from the field. The Patriots were one of six 2011 season playoff teams to be under .500 after their first three games;  the others were the Steelers, Broncos, Lions, Packers, and Saints (who were sitting at 0-3 by this time).

For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.

Following that, the 1970s energy crisis ensued which included the 1973\u201375 recession, the 1973 oil crisis as well as the 1979 energy crisis beginning as a prelude to a disastrous economic climate injected with stagflation; the combination between high unemployment and high inflation. However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed above the 1,000 mark (1,003.16) for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market. Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the 1973\u20131974 stock market crash; with the situation being exacerbated by the events surrounding the Yom Kippur War.

The Ravens entered the game hoping to be able to avenge the AFC Championship loss of the previous season, which came at the hands of the Patriots.  New England started off fast as they drew to a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However Baltimore scored 2 straight touchdowns to take the lead with 1:47 left to go in the half. Then Brady scored a touchdown right at the end of the half to retake the lead 20-14. The second half started off with a touchdown pass from Flacco to Dennis Pitta to put the Ravens on top 21-20. Then the Patriots retook the lead when Tom Brady scored a touchdown. After that the Baltimore defense began to step it up and held the Pats to a field goal. Then the momentum shifted as Baltimore scored a touchdown (Flacco to Torrey Smith). After forcing a Patriots punt, the Ravens drove down the field to score a field goal as time expired to win the game 31-30. The Ravens avenged the AFC Championship loss and improved to 2-1 and continued their unbeaten record at home from the previous year along with continuing their streak of winning after a loss. Based on Torrey Smith's performance through personal hardship, this game was ranked #9 on NFL.com's Top 20 NFL Games of 2012 as Showing Up. Smith finishes with six receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns. This game was also remembered for 2 controversial incidents. Late in the 4th quarter, with New England leading 30-28, coach John Harbaugh was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for coming out onto the field, which by NFL rules, is prohibited. However, Harbaugh was claiming that he was trying to only call a timeout to save time for his team. Since the NFL was using replacement refs at the time, and not the original refs, this was another controversial incident involving replacement refs. The penalty resulted in an irate Ravens crowd chanting the word \"Bullshit\" 3 separate times in just over a minute during the Patriots last drive, which was picked up by NBC microphones and was clearly audible during the broadcast. Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels said \"That's the loudest manuere chant I've ever heard\". The other controversy is the winning field goal by Tucker. The ball, after it had been kicked, sailed over the top of the right upright. It was ruled \"good\", giving Baltimore the win. However, clear replays show that the ball was awfully close to sailing wide of the upright, which would've resulted in the kick being no good and giving the Patriots the win. Since field goals are not reviewable, the play could not be reviewed. Patriots coach Bill Belichick, as he was leaving the field, grabbed one of the officials, resulting in him being fined $50,000 by the NFL.

In the decade before the Civil War net exports were roughly constant; postwar they varied erratically around pre-war levels, but fell significantly in 1877 and became negative in 1878 and 1879.

The decrease in gold exports was considered by some to be a result of changing monetary conditions. The demands for gold during this period were as a speculative vehicle, and for its primary use in the foreign exchange markets financing international trade.

The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500. The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one. Vesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people.

Penalties on Washington's defense helped allow a short McNabb to Brian Westbrook touchdown pass on Philadelphia's opening drive. A fumble by L. J. Smith gave Washington the ball inside Eagle territory, and Jason Campbell capitalized with a touchdown pass to James Thrash, the former Eagle. The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20.

Pew also found that the Catholic population is aging, forming a higher percentage of the elderly population than the young, and retention rates are also worse among the young. About 41% of those \"young\" raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith. Conversions to Catholicism are rare, with 89% of current Catholics being raised in the religion; 8% of current Catholics are ex-Protestants, 2% were raised unaffiliated, and 1% in other religions (Orthodox Christian, Mormon or other nontrinitarian, Buddhist, Muslim, etc.), with Jews and Hindus least likely to become Catholic of all the religious groups surveyed. Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. This is credited to the more liberal stance of the Church since Vatican II, where conversion to Catholicism is no longer encouraged, and the de-emphasizing of basic Catholic religious beliefs in Catholic education. Still, according to the 2015 Pew Research Center, \"the Catholic share of the population has been relatively stable over the long term, according to a variety of other surveys  By race, 59% of Catholics are non-Hispanic white, 34% Hispanic, 3% black, 3% Asian, and 2% mixed or Native American.

In 2015, Hispanics are 38%, while blacks and Asians are still at 3% each.

The Giants finally got on the board late in the first quarter courtesy of a 7-yard Nicks reception. Following a Giants fumble in the second quarter, Dallas quarterback Tony Romo was hit hard by linebacker Michael Boley and left the game with a clavicle fracture (Notably, Romo was the fifth quarterback the Giants defense knocked out of a game this year, after Moore, Cutler, Collins, and Hill). After Cowboys kick returner Dez Bryant returned a Dodge punt 93 yards for a touchdown, the Giants scored two consecutive touchdowns; an 8-yard pass to Nicks and a 14-yard pass to Smith. The Giants opened the second half with two more back-to-back touchdowns; a 25-yard pass to Manningham and a 30-yard Jacobs run.

In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million. By 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in East Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in West Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork.

        "question": "Passage: The largest population centres of the Sinhalese diaspora are mainly situated in Europe, North America and Australia. The city of Melbourne contains just under half of the Sri Lankan Australians. The 2011 census recorded 86,412 Sri Lanka born in Australia. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above Somali language but behind Hindi language and Belarusian language). Sinhalese Australians have an exceptionally low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka. In the Canada 2011 Census, 7,220 people identified themselves as of Sri Lankan Canadians, out of 139,415 Sri Lankans. There are a small amount of Sri Lankans in India, scattered around the country, but mainly living in and around the North India and South India regions. Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand. The Sri Lankan American number about 12,000 in the U.S. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Many Sri Lankans in Italy have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples, and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Though British Sri Lankans people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK. The UK government does not record statistics on the basis of language or ethnicity and all Sri Lankans are classified into one group as Asian British or Asian Other. Question: How many more Sri Lankans live in the United States than in New Zealand? ",

        "question": "Passage: In 1917, the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works) was organized at Naval Training Station Great Lakes. When the US entered World War I in April 1917, the Navy had an immediate requirement to expand the Great Lakes Station in order to house, process, and train 20,000 naval recruits, this number would rise to 50,000 by the end of the year. Lieutenant Malachi Elliott, a graduate of the US Naval Academy, was appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes on 18 June 1917, at which time about 500 enlisted men had been assigned to the Public Works Department. Seeing that the department would need to expand with skilled craftsmen, architects, draftsmen, designers, and other professional and technical people, he began to screen incoming recruits with these skills. Finding many, but not enough, he expanded to recruiting civilians outside of the installation, getting many men willing to join the Navy as petty officers, with the understanding that qualified men could later apply for commissions. This allowed the Public Works Department to grow to nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were organized into the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works), which was essentially the Public Works Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the Public Works Officers exercised technical control. In October 1917, the regiment began building Camp Paul Jones at San Diego. With its completion, on 30 December 1917, the regiment became \"fully operational\" with 1,500 men organized into three battalions. By April 1918, the regiment consisted of 2,400 in five battalions. Men were withdrawn for assignments in the US and abroad. In spring of 1918, 100 men were given special mechanics and ordnance training before being sent to St. Nazaire, France, to assemble 14\"/50 caliber railway gun. Later they would join the gun crews and perform combat duties along the railway lines in proximity to the Empire of Germany lines. The Twelfth Regiment reached its peak strength 5 November 1918; 55 officers and 6,211 enlisted men formed into 11 battalions. However, with the end of the war on Armistice of 11 November 1918, the regiment gradually faded away by the end of 1918.

        "question": "Passage:  The team rallied for a win over the Washington Redskins at FedExField in week 10. Penalties on Washington's defense helped allow a short McNabb to Brian Westbrook touchdown pass on Philadelphia's opening drive. A fumble by L. J. Smith gave Washington the ball inside Eagle territory, and Jason Campbell capitalized with a touchdown pass to James Thrash, the former Eagle. The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20. The Eagles got the ball back with four minutes to play, and Westbrook immediately took a short pass and broke free for a 57-yard touchdown to go ahead 26-25 (the two-point conversion failing again). The defense came up big again, with Mike Patterson sacking Campbell to jar the ball loose, and Trent Cole recovering. Westbrook carried it in from ten yards out to seal the deal. McNabb, who surpassed Ron Jaworski for the most career completions in franchise history (2,090 at game's end), passed for 251 yards and four touchdowns in the 33-25 win.

There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration (African American) of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry.

The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax. In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures.

A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahmss arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms), (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46\u201349). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (cantata) (1863\u20131868), his Two String Quartets, Op. 51 (Brahms) Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865\u20131873), the third piano quartet (1855\u20131875), and most notably his Symphony No. 1 (Brahms) which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.

Of that 7%, 9% are under the age of 18. This means that 24% of Kensington Markets population is non-Canadian citizens, a figure that speaks to Kensington Markets character as a hub for multiculturalism. Furthermore, in 2011 the National Household Survey reported very similar data. Although the population accounted by citizenship status increased from 2006 and 2011, the percentage of those with Canadian citizenship versus those without the citizenship remained the same.  In 2006, 2800 residents reported that they were Canadian citizens whereas 870 residents reported they did not hold Canadian citizenship .

After a scoreless first quarter, the Patriots struck first with a Gostkowski 31-yard field goal.  However, the Jets would fire back with running back Kevan Barlow getting a touchdown on a two-yard run.  Gostkowski would get one more field goal for New England, in the form of a 21-yarder.  In the third quarter, New York kicker Mike Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets continued their pursuit, as Pennington completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Cotchery.  The Patriots tried to fight back, as Brady completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Caldwell, following it up with a successful two-point conversion pass to Caldwell.  However, New York's defense managed to bottle up any chance of a New England comeback.   With the loss, the Patriots would lead the Jets by one game in the AFC East at 6-3.

To print an 80-minute feature film can cost US$1,500 to $2,500, so making thousands of prints for a wide-release movie can cost millions of dollars. In contrast, at the maximum 250 megabit-per-second data rate (as defined by Digital Cinema Initiatives for digital cinema), a feature-length movie can be stored on an Commercial off-the-shelf 300 Gigabyte hard drive for $50 and a broad release of 4000 digital prints might cost $200,000. In addition hard drives can be returned to distributors for reuse. With several hundred movies distributed every year, the industry saves billions of dollars. The digital-cinema roll-out was stalled by the slow pace at which exhibitors acquired digital projectors, since the savings would be seen not by themselves but by distribution companies. The Virtual Print Fee model was created to address this by passing some of the saving on to the cinemas. As a consequence of the rapid conversion to digital projection, the number of theatrical releases exhibited on film is dwindling.

Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken. When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees.

The balanced, well-executed seven-minute drive was capped off by a 4-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The extra point was missed by Lawrence Tynes. On their next possession, the Giants were driving for more, but a tipped ball resulted in an interception inside the red zone. The 49ers responded with a nice drive of their own, aided by a personal foul on linebacker Antonio Pierce and several third down conversions.  San Francisco cashed in with a touchdown from Trent Dilfer to Arnaz Battle. Following a Frank Gore fumble, the Giants took control. The running game, which accounted for 140 total yards helped the Giants move back in front. Brandon Jacobs scored on a five-yard run for a 13-7 lead. After an interception by Sam Madison, the Giants added a 30-yard field goal by Tynes. Tynes made it 19-7 at the half with another field goal, this time from 39 yards, inside the final minute. The Giants defense dominated in the second half, notching six sacks and four total turnovers. Osi Umenyiora put the game away with a sack, forced fumble, and 75-yard touchdown return up the field for a 26-7 lead. The Niners got two points back on a blocked punt out of the end zone but Antonio Pierce redeemed himself for two earlier personal fouls by intercepting Trent Dilfer and returning the ball inside the 10.

The poet Du Fu (712-770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it. A parade of great Tang poets also includes Chen Ziang (661-702), Wang Zhihuan (688-742), Meng Haoran (689-740), Bai Juyi (772-846), Li He (790-816), Du Mu (803-852), Wen Tingyun (812-870), (listed chronologically) and Li Shangyin (813-858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure, and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu, now ranked alongside Li Bai. The distinctively different Ci (poetry) poetry form began its development during the Tang as Central Asian and other musical influences flowed through its cosmopolitan society.

The Bears responded with QB Jay Cutler firing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Johnny Knox. The Vikings responded with Favre hooking up with running back Chester Taylor on a 10-yard TD pass, along with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 52-yard field goal.

Ancient Egyptian agriculture relied on the  Nile River and its seasonal flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the Paleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus. Agriculture in India, wheat, barley, and jujube were domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats. Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated in Mehrgarh by 8,000\u20136,000 BC.

Lieutenant Malachi Elliott, a graduate of the US Naval Academy, was appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes on 18 June 1917, at which time about 500 enlisted men had been assigned to the Public Works Department. Seeing that the department would need to expand with skilled craftsmen, architects, draftsmen, designers, and other professional and technical people, he began to screen incoming recruits with these skills. Finding many, but not enough, he expanded to recruiting civilians outside of the installation, getting many men willing to join the Navy as petty officers, with the understanding that qualified men could later apply for commissions. This allowed the Public Works Department to grow to nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were organized into the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works), which was essentially the Public Works Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the Public Works Officers exercised technical control. In October 1917, the regiment began building Camp Paul Jones at San Diego. With its completion, on 30 December 1917, the regiment became \"fully operational\" with 1,500 men organized into three battalions. By April 1918, the regiment consisted of 2,400 in five battalions. Men were withdrawn for assignments in the US and abroad. In spring of 1918, 100 men were given special mechanics and ordnance training before being sent to St. Nazaire, France, to assemble 14\"/50 caliber railway gun. Later they would join the gun crews and perform combat duties along the railway lines in proximity to the Empire of Germany lines. The Twelfth Regiment reached its peak strength 5 November 1918; 55 officers and 6,211 enlisted men formed into 11 battalions.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4.

Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahmss arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms), (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46\u201349). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (cantata) (1863\u20131868), his Two String Quartets, Op. 51 (Brahms) Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865\u20131873), the third piano quartet (1855\u20131875), and most notably his Symphony No. 1 (Brahms) which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.

The earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the Yangtze River, is carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago. Farming gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC). At Damaidi in Ningxia, 3,172 Neolithic signs in China dating to 6000\u20135000 BC have been discovered, \"featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing\". These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC, Dadiwan culture from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC.

Pew also found that the Catholic population is aging, forming a higher percentage of the elderly population than the young, and retention rates are also worse among the young. About 41% of those \"young\" raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith. Conversions to Catholicism are rare, with 89% of current Catholics being raised in the religion; 8% of current Catholics are ex-Protestants, 2% were raised unaffiliated, and 1% in other religions (Orthodox Christian, Mormon or other nontrinitarian, Buddhist, Muslim, etc.), with Jews and Hindus least likely to become Catholic of all the religious groups surveyed. Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. This is credited to the more liberal stance of the Church since Vatican II, where conversion to Catholicism is no longer encouraged, and the de-emphasizing of basic Catholic religious beliefs in Catholic education. Still, according to the 2015 Pew Research Center, \"the Catholic share of the population has been relatively stable over the long term, according to a variety of other surveys  By race, 59% of Catholics are non-Hispanic white, 34% Hispanic, 3% black, 3% Asian, and 2% mixed or Native American.

In 2015, Hispanics are 38%, while blacks and Asians are still at 3% each. Because conversion away from Catholicism is presently occurring much more quickly among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites, it is unclear whether they will outnumber non-Hispanic whites among Catholics or not in the foreseeable future.

The Patriots droved 51 yards in seven-and-a-half minutes to the Jets 14, but after a false-start penalty, Gostkowski missed a 37-yard field goal. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots went on a 15 play, 75-yard marathon, taking over eight minutes off the clock, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Welker early in the second quarter. After accruing no passing yards during the first quarter, the Jets marched 73 yards in 12 plays, taking just under 7 minutes off the clock, scoring on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Braylon Edwards. Two possessions later, after two incomplete passes, Brady hit Hernandez for a 46-yard catch-and-run, then hit Moss for a 34-yard touchdown pass on an incredible one-handed catch, beating the vaunted Darrelle Revis, re-taking a 14-7 lead. The Jets answered, marching to the Patriots 31, and Nick Folk  was good on a 49-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 14-10 at halftime. After a Jets punt, the Patriots drove to the Jets 47, but Antonio Cromartie intercepted his pass attempt for Moss at the 3.

The pivotal game in this series turned out to be Game 2, in which reserve player Ed Sprague Jr. hit a 9th-inning two-run home run off Braves closer Jeff Reardon to give the Blue Jays a 5-4 lead, which would hold up. After winning Game 3 thanks to Candy Maldonados ninth inning RBI hit and Game 4 due to Jimmy Keys superb 7\u2153 inning pitching effort in which he retired 15 straight batters (five innings), the Jays could not win the Series on home turf as the Braves struck back with a 7-2 win in Game 5. Game 6 in Atlanta, with the Blue Jays leading 3 games to 2, was a very close game. Toronto was one strike away from winning in the bottom of the 9th inning, 2-1, but Otis Nixon singled in the tying run off the Blue Jays closer Tom Henke. It was the first run the Toronto bullpen had given up in the series. The game was decided in the 11th inning, when Dave Winfield doubled down the left-field line, driving in two runs. The Braves would again come within one run in the bottom of the 11th, but Jays reliever Mike Timlin fielded Otis Nixons bunt, throwing to Joe Carter at first base for the final out.

One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines.

This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge (Budapest) linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, \u00d3buda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the countrys administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Danube Swabians in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain.

In 2012 the research organization Sreda published Arena Atlas, a detailed enumeration of religious populations and nationalities in Russia, based on a large-sample country-wide survey. They found that 46.8% of Russians declared themselves Christians (including 41% Russian Orthodox, 1.5% simply Orthodox or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 4.1% unaffiliated Christians, and less than 1% for both Catholic and Protestant), while 25% were spiritual but not religious, 13% were atheists, 6.5% were Muslims, 1.2% were followers of \"traditional religions honoring gods and ancestors\" (including Rodnovery, Tengrism and other ethnic religions), and 0.5% were Tibetan Buddhism. However, later that year, the Levada Center estimated that 76% of Russians were Christians, and in June 2013, the Public Opinion Foundation estimated that 65% of the population was Christian.

In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000\u2013120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353.   While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

The game was played in a driving rainstorm as both teams struggled to move the ball early. With 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Mike Nugent was ready to attempt a 34-yard field goal, but holder Ben Graham could not handle the snap in the slippery conditions, and the Jets were denied. It was the second straight week Graham had flubbed a snap, but this one could be blamed on the wet conditions. The two teams would trade punts for the rest of the half. In the third quarter, Dolphins coach Nick Saban inserted backup quarterback Cleo Lemon into the game, replacing an ineffective Joey Harrington. Finally, the Jets went on a drive with 6:15 left in the third quarter, with Chad Pennington scrambling for 15 yards and moving into the Dolphins' red zone when Yeremiah Bell was flagged for pass interference. Nugent knocked in a 22-yard field goal for the first points of the game. But Lemon rallied Miami, completing two long passes to Randy McMichael and Ronnie Brown picking up a long run before Lemon tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to McMichael, and the Dolphins led 7-3 with 13:26 left in the game. Pennington showed poise in leading the Jets back to take the lead, completing key passes to Brad Smith and Leon Washington before finding Cotchery on a 31-yard completion to the Miami 1-yard line, but the Jets challenged, saying that Cotchery was brought down after he broke the plane of the end zone, and the referee agreed, giving the Jets a 10-7 lead with 8:04 remaining in the game. Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line. Lemon led Miami downfield, completing key passes to Derek Hagan and Sammy Morris before Mare tied the game with a 25-yard field goal. With 2:09 to play, the Jets' biggest play of the season took place. Pennington flipped a short screen pass to Washington, who found a hole and scampered 64 yards down to the Miami 16-yard line.

There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one. Vesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4.

The Ravens entered the game hoping to be able to avenge the AFC Championship loss of the previous season, which came at the hands of the Patriots.  New England started off fast as they drew to a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However Baltimore scored 2 straight touchdowns to take the lead with 1:47 left to go in the half. Then Brady scored a touchdown right at the end of the half to retake the lead 20-14. The second half started off with a touchdown pass from Flacco to Dennis Pitta to put the Ravens on top 21-20. Then the Patriots retook the lead when Tom Brady scored a touchdown. After that the Baltimore defense began to step it up and held the Pats to a field goal. Then the momentum shifted as Baltimore scored a touchdown (Flacco to Torrey Smith). After forcing a Patriots punt, the Ravens drove down the field to score a field goal as time expired to win the game 31-30. The Ravens avenged the AFC Championship loss and improved to 2-1 and continued their unbeaten record at home from the previous year along with continuing their streak of winning after a loss. Based on Torrey Smith's performance through personal hardship, this game was ranked #9 on NFL.com's Top 20 NFL Games of 2012 as Showing Up. Smith finishes with six receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns. This game was also remembered for 2 controversial incidents. Late in the 4th quarter, with New England leading 30-28, coach John Harbaugh was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for coming out onto the field, which by NFL rules, is prohibited. However, Harbaugh was claiming that he was trying to only call a timeout to save time for his team. Since the NFL was using replacement refs at the time, and not the original refs, this was another controversial incident involving replacement refs. The penalty resulted in an irate Ravens crowd chanting the word \"Bullshit\" 3 separate times in just over a minute during the Patriots last drive, which was picked up by NBC microphones and was clearly audible during the broadcast. Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels said \"That's the loudest manuere chant I've ever heard\". The other controversy is the winning field goal by Tucker. The ball, after it had been kicked, sailed over the top of the right upright. It was ruled \"good\", giving Baltimore the win. However, clear replays show that the ball was awfully close to sailing wide of the upright, which would've resulted in the kick being no good and giving the Patriots the win. Since field goals are not reviewable, the play could not be reviewed. Patriots coach Bill Belichick, as he was leaving the field, grabbed one of the officials, resulting in him being fined $50,000 by the NFL.

According to the CIA World Factbook, U.S. income inequality ranked 41st highest among 156 countries in 2017 (i.e., 74% of countries have a more equal income distribution). According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 1% of income households earned about a 9% share of the pre-tax income in 1979, versus 19% in 2007 and 17% in 2014. For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the Great Recession, and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the Affordable Care Act).

He included the musical saw, e.g., in the film music for The New Babylon (1929), in The Nose (opera) (1928), and in Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera) (1934). Shostakovich and other composers of his time used the term \"Flexaton\" to mark the musical saw. \"Flexaton\" just means \"to flex a tone\"\u2014the saw is flexed to change the pitch. Unfortunately, there exists another instrument called Flexatone, so there has been confusion for a long time. Aram Khachaturian, who knew Shostakovichs music included the musical saw in his Piano Concerto (Khachaturian) (1936) in the second movement. Another composer was the Swiss Arthur Honegger, who included the saw in his opera Antigone (Honegger) in 1924 . The Romanian composer George Enescu used the musical saw at the end of the second act of his opera \u0152dipe (opera) (1931) to show in an extensive glissando\u2014which begins with the mezzo-soprano and is continued by the saw\u2014the death and ascension of the sphinx killed by Oedipus. The Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi wrote a part for the saw in his quarter-tone piece Quattro pezzi per orchestra (1959). German composer Hans Werner Henze took the saw to characterize the mean hero of his tragical opera Elegy for young lovers (1961). Other composers were Krysztof Penderecki with Fluorescences (1961), De natura sonoris Nr. 2 (1971) and the opera Ubu Rex (1990), Bernd Alois Zimmermann with Stille und Umkehr (1970), George Crumb with Ancient voices of children (1970), John Corigliano with The Mannheim Rocket (2001). Chaya Czernowin used the saw in her opera \"PNIMA...Ins Innere\" (2000) to represent the character of the grandfather, who is traumatized by the Holocaust. There are Further Leif Segerstam, Hans Zender (orchestration of \"5 pr\u00e9ludes\" by Claude Debussy), Franz Schreker (opera Christophorus) and Oscar Strasnoy (opera Le bal). Russian composer Lera Auerbach wrote for the saw in her ballet The Little Mermaid (2005), in her symphonic poem Dreams and Whispers of Poseidon (2005), in her oratorio \"Requiem Dresden \u2013 Ode to Peace\" (2012), in her Piano Concerto No.1 (2015), in her comic oratorio The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie (2016) and in her violin concerto Nr.4 \"NyX \u2013 Fractured dreams\" (2017).

From September 1-15, 1865, the Powder River Expedition (1865) battled Native Americans in the Powder River Battles (1865) near the future site of Broadus. On March 17, 1876, the Battle of Powder River occurred in the south-central part of the county, about  southwest of Broadus. In June 1876 six companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States) led by Major Marcus Reno marched along the Powder River nearly to the mouth of the Little Powder before turning west toward the Battle of Little Bighorn. On November 1, 1878, Powderville, Montana became the first establishment in the county, as the Powder River Telegraph Station, on the Fort Keogh to Deadwood, South Dakota telegraph line. On April 5, 1879, the Mizpah Creek Incidents began near the Powderville telegraph station in the extreme northern part of the county.

        "question": "Passage:  This game was played in the shadow of the death of WR Torrey Smith's brother, who had died in a motorcycle crash the night before. The Ravens entered the game hoping to be able to avenge the AFC Championship loss of the previous season, which came at the hands of the Patriots.  New England started off fast as they drew to a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However Baltimore scored 2 straight touchdowns to take the lead with 1:47 left to go in the half. Then Brady scored a touchdown right at the end of the half to retake the lead 20-14. The second half started off with a touchdown pass from Flacco to Dennis Pitta to put the Ravens on top 21-20. Then the Patriots retook the lead when Tom Brady scored a touchdown. After that the Baltimore defense began to step it up and held the Pats to a field goal. Then the momentum shifted as Baltimore scored a touchdown (Flacco to Torrey Smith). After forcing a Patriots punt, the Ravens drove down the field to score a field goal as time expired to win the game 31-30. The Ravens avenged the AFC Championship loss and improved to 2-1 and continued their unbeaten record at home from the previous year along with continuing their streak of winning after a loss. Based on Torrey Smith's performance through personal hardship, this game was ranked #9 on NFL.com's Top 20 NFL Games of 2012 as Showing Up. Smith finishes with six receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns. This game was also remembered for 2 controversial incidents. Late in the 4th quarter, with New England leading 30-28, coach John Harbaugh was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for coming out onto the field, which by NFL rules, is prohibited. However, Harbaugh was claiming that he was trying to only call a timeout to save time for his team. Since the NFL was using replacement refs at the time, and not the original refs, this was another controversial incident involving replacement refs. The penalty resulted in an irate Ravens crowd chanting the word \"Bullshit\" 3 separate times in just over a minute during the Patriots last drive, which was picked up by NBC microphones and was clearly audible during the broadcast. Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels said \"That's the loudest manuere chant I've ever heard\". The other controversy is the winning field goal by Tucker. The ball, after it had been kicked, sailed over the top of the right upright. It was ruled \"good\", giving Baltimore the win. However, clear replays show that the ball was awfully close to sailing wide of the upright, which would've resulted in the kick being no good and giving the Patriots the win. Since field goals are not reviewable, the play could not be reviewed. Patriots coach Bill Belichick, as he was leaving the field, grabbed one of the officials, resulting in him being fined $50,000 by the NFL. Question: How many points did the Ravens win the game by? ",

In the summer of 1865, the United States government sent over 2,000 U.S. soldiers into the Powder River country to combat Native Americans from the Cheyenne people, Lakota people, and Arapaho people tribes. From September 1-15, 1865, the Powder River Expedition (1865) battled Native Americans in the Powder River Battles (1865) near the future site of Broadus. On March 17, 1876, the Battle of Powder River occurred in the south-central part of the county, about  southwest of Broadus. In June 1876 six companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States) led by Major Marcus Reno marched along the Powder River nearly to the mouth of the Little Powder before turning west toward the Battle of Little Bighorn. On November 1, 1878, Powderville, Montana became the first establishment in the county, as the Powder River Telegraph Station, on the Fort Keogh to Deadwood, South Dakota telegraph line. On April 5, 1879, the Mizpah Creek Incidents began near the Powderville telegraph station in the extreme northern part of the county. In the early 1880s, a large area of Southeastern Montana became Custer County, Montana, including the present area encompassed by Powder River County. In February 1900, the Broadus post office was established, named after the Broaddus family. In October 1918, publication of a newspaper, the Broadus Independent (now called the Powder River Examiner), began in Broadus, and is still published today.

Seeing that the department would need to expand with skilled craftsmen, architects, draftsmen, designers, and other professional and technical people, he began to screen incoming recruits with these skills. Finding many, but not enough, he expanded to recruiting civilians outside of the installation, getting many men willing to join the Navy as petty officers, with the understanding that qualified men could later apply for commissions. This allowed the Public Works Department to grow to nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were organized into the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works), which was essentially the Public Works Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the Public Works Officers exercised technical control. In October 1917, the regiment began building Camp Paul Jones at San Diego. With its completion, on 30 December 1917, the regiment became \"fully operational\" with 1,500 men organized into three battalions. By April 1918, the regiment consisted of 2,400 in five battalions. Men were withdrawn for assignments in the US and abroad. In spring of 1918, 100 men were given special mechanics and ordnance training before being sent to St. Nazaire, France, to assemble 14\"/50 caliber railway gun. Later they would join the gun crews and perform combat duties along the railway lines in proximity to the Empire of Germany lines. The Twelfth Regiment reached its peak strength 5 November 1918; 55 officers and 6,211 enlisted men formed into 11 battalions. However, with the end of the war on Armistice of 11 November 1918, the regiment gradually faded away by the end of 1918.

From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilization soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted Local council (Israel) status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents.

Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the Contiguous United States with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Floridas most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles.

China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002. China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence. This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts. However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases. Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs. Singapore has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides Iceland, in the world, at 3%. Cambodia has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000.

An additional 20,000 H-1Bs are available to foreign nationals holding a masters or higher degree from U.S. universities. In addition, excluded from the ceiling are all H-1B non-immigrants who work at (but not necessarily for) universities, non-profit research facilities associated with universities, and government research facilities.  Universities can employ an unlimited number of foreign workers otherwise qualifying for the H-1B as cap-exempt.  This also means that contractors working at but not directly employed by the institutions may be exempt from the cap as well. However, employers must show 1) the majority of the workers duties will be performed at the qualifying institution, organization or entity and 2) the job duties directly and predominantly further the essential purpose, mission objectives or functions of the qualifying institution, organization or entity.  Free Trade Agreements carve out 1,400 H-1B1 visas for Chilean nationals and 5,400 H-1B1 visas for Singapore nationals. However, if these reserved visas are not used, then they are made available in the next fiscal year to applicants from other countries. Due to these unlimited exemptions and roll-overs, the number of H-1B visas issued each year is significantly more than the 65,000 cap, with 117,828 having been issued in FY2010, 129,552 in FY2011, and 135,991 in FY2012.

There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above Somali language but behind Hindi language and Belarusian language).

        "question": "Passage:  The Indianapolis Colts began their 2011 season at Reliant Stadium against the Houston Texans.  For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.  The second quarter continued Houston's dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34-0, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.  The Colts scored their first and the only points scored in the second half with a Reggie Wayne touchdown from Collins in the fourth quarter.  The Colts went on to lose to the Texans 34-7, their second straight season starting 0-1. Question: How many points did the Colts lose by? ",

        "question": "Passage:  Eight years after their last game in Indianapolis (a 29-13 victory), the Bears returned to play the Colts in week five. The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4. They ended the game with 522 offensive yards, the most since they recorded 542 in a 1989 win against the Lions and the most in a loss since 1940.

The perceived stalemate along with British governments hints of a compromise and secret approaches in the early 1990s led republican leaders increasingly to look for a political agreement to end the conflict, with a broadening dissociation of Sinn F\u00e9in from the IRA. Following negotiations with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and secret talks with British civil servants, the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire in 1994 on the understanding that Sinn F\u00e9in would be included in political talks for a settlement. When the British government then demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn F\u00e9in into multiparty talks, the organisation called off its ceasefire in February 1996. The renewed bombings caused severe economic damage, with the 1996 Manchester bombing and the Docklands bombing causing approximately \u00a3800 million in combined damage. After the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The IRAs armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of approximately 1,800 people. The dead included around 1,100 members of the British security forces, and about 630 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275\u2013300 members, of an estimated 10,000 total over the 30-year period. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA had detonated 19,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the United Kingdom, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it \"the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history\".

There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration (African American) of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry.

The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax.

They also remove phosphorus in the form of P2O5 at the rate of 0.25 pound per bushel (1 bushel  38 pounds at 12% moisture). Phosphate is thus applied at a rate of 30 to 40 kg/ha, or 30 to 40 lb/acre. Oats remove potash (K2O) at a rate of 0.19 pound per bushel, which causes it to use 15\u201330 kg/ha, or 13\u201327 lb/acre. Usually, 50\u2013100 kg/ha (45\u201390 lb/ac) of nitrogen in the form of urea or ammonia is sufficient, as oats use about one pound per bushel. A sufficient amount of nitrogen is particularly important for plant height and hence, straw quality and yield.

Between 1998 and 2004 IQ declined by about the same amount as it gained between 1989 and 1998. They speculate that \"a contributing factor in this recent fall could be a simultaneous decline in proportions of students entering 3-year advanced-level school programs for 16-18-year-olds.\" The same authors in a more comprehensive 2008 study, again on Danish male conscripts, found that there was a 1.5-point increase between 1988 and 1998, but a 1.5-point decrease between 1998 and 2003/2004. A possible contributing factor to the more recent decline may be changes in the Danish educational system.

The 1956 Winter Olympics were the first internationally televised Olympic Games, and the 1960 Winter Olympics had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialised television broadcasting networks\u2014CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) allocated US$660,000. In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375 million for the American broadcast rights of the 1998 Winter Olympics, while NBC spent US$3.5 billion for the American rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012. In 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38 billion contract with the International Olympic Committee to broadcast the Olympics through the 2020 Summer Olympics, the most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history.

        "question": "Passage:  Now functioning as a spoiler, the Eagles traveled to face the New Orleans Saints at the Superdome - site of two losses in 2006, including one in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. The first quarter would be a shootout, with the teams combined for 5 touchdowns and over 300 yards of offense. On the third play from scrimmage, Donovan McNabb scrambled for a 40-yard gain, but fumbled, only to have the ball recovered in the end zone for a touchdown by receiver Kevin Curtis. A 52-yard bomb to wideout Devery Henderson keyed a four-play drive ending in a New Orleans touchdown by running back Aaron Stecker. McNabb's second fumble was recovered by New Orleans in Philadelphia territory, setting up another short touchdown for Stecker. The Eagles offense again moved the ball and Correll Buckhalter scored on a 20-yard scamper and the game was tied 14-14. On Philadelphia's next drive, McNabb found the open Reggie Brown for a 31-yard touchdown pass and a Philadelphia lead. In the second quarter, David Akers and Martin Gramatica traded field goals as the offenses settled down. The Saints had 2nd-and-goal from the 1-yard line on their opening drive of the second half, but the Eagles' defense stepped up with another big goal line stand and the seven-point lead was preserved. McNabb then led the Eagles on a 98-yard, seven-minute drive that ended in a 9-yard touchdown pass to Greg Lewis. The Saints answered with two field goals to get within eight at 31-23, but a McNabb to Curtis touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter wrapped things up for Philadelphia. McNabb looked mobile and was effective, throwing for three scores and 263 yards. Brian Westbrook had 100 rushing yards, while Curtis had 78 receiving yards, a touchdown reception, and a fumble recovery for a touchdown. The second straight win raised the Eagles' record to 7-8 and gave them a chance to finish .500 with a win over the Buffalo Bills. Question: How many field goals were scored in the second quarter? ",

About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%.

He included the musical saw, e.g., in the film music for The New Babylon (1929), in The Nose (opera) (1928), and in Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera) (1934). Shostakovich and other composers of his time used the term \"Flexaton\" to mark the musical saw. \"Flexaton\" just means \"to flex a tone\"\u2014the saw is flexed to change the pitch. Unfortunately, there exists another instrument called Flexatone, so there has been confusion for a long time. Aram Khachaturian, who knew Shostakovichs music included the musical saw in his Piano Concerto (Khachaturian) (1936) in the second movement. Another composer was the Swiss Arthur Honegger, who included the saw in his opera Antigone (Honegger) in 1924 . The Romanian composer George Enescu used the musical saw at the end of the second act of his opera \u0152dipe (opera) (1931) to show in an extensive glissando\u2014which begins with the mezzo-soprano and is continued by the saw\u2014the death and ascension of the sphinx killed by Oedipus. The Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi wrote a part for the saw in his quarter-tone piece Quattro pezzi per orchestra (1959). German composer Hans Werner Henze took the saw to characterize the mean hero of his tragical opera Elegy for young lovers (1961). Other composers were Krysztof Penderecki with Fluorescences (1961), De natura sonoris Nr. 2 (1971) and the opera Ubu Rex (1990), Bernd Alois Zimmermann with Stille und Umkehr (1970), George Crumb with Ancient voices of children (1970), John Corigliano with The Mannheim Rocket (2001). Chaya Czernowin used the saw in her opera \"PNIMA...Ins Innere\" (2000) to represent the character of the grandfather, who is traumatized by the Holocaust. There are Further Leif Segerstam, Hans Zender (orchestration of \"5 pr\u00e9ludes\" by Claude Debussy), Franz Schreker (opera Christophorus) and Oscar Strasnoy (opera Le bal).

Although the population accounted by citizenship status increased from 2006 and 2011, the percentage of those with Canadian citizenship versus those without the citizenship remained the same.  In 2006, 2800 residents reported that they were Canadian citizens whereas 870 residents reported they did not hold Canadian citizenship . In 2011, 2950 residents reported they were Canadian citizens whereas 930 residents reported that they did not hold Canadian citizenship. Comparing this to the Canadian ratio between Canadian and non-Canadian citizenship data from the census for 2006 and 2011 the ratio changed by 0.4% resulting in an increase in non-Canadian citizens within the population that received the long form survey and the National Household survey (Census 2006; Census 2011 NHS). Although this percent increase is small, when speaking on the national scale, this 0.4% increase in ratio involved 32,852,320 respondents for 2011 and 31,241,030 respondents for 2006 (Census 2006; Census 2011). Comparing that with the minimal increase which was 0.3% in ratio for Kensington where the population was not as substantial, this increase is not as substantial as well (Census 2006; Census 2011 NHS). Question: In 2006, how many more residents were Canadian citizens than those who did not hold Canadian citizenship? ",

        "question": "Passage:  The Browns headed into Kansas City for their last road game of the year to take on the Chiefs in Week 15. The Browns and Chiefs traded field goals in the first quarter, and then Josh Cribbs returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, setting an NFL record with his 7th kickoff return for a touchdown. After another Phil Dawson field goal in the second, the Chiefs scored three straight touchdowns to take a 24-13 lead. However, Cribbs again ran a kickoff back for a touchdown, this time for 103 yards and extending his NFL record to eight kickoff return touchdowns. In the second half, Jerome Harrison rushed for three touchdowns and amassed a filibuster-proof majority of his 286 rushing yards. This set a Browns' rushing record for a single game, was the record for most rushing yards in the NFL this season, and was the third most rushing yards in a game in NFL history. Matt Cassel's final desperation pass ricocheted off the cross bar, and the Browns defeated the Chiefs 41-34, with their highest point total of the season. With the win, the Browns improved to 3-11 and finished the season 2-6 on the road. Cribbs was named the AFC special teams player of the week for the second straight week. On December 21, Mike Holmgren was hired by the Browns to take over as their president. His duties will include personnel management, and he may hire a general manager to assist him.

        "question": "Passage: The 1970s marked a time of economic uncertainty and troubled relations between the U.S. and certain Middle-Eastern countries. To begin with, the decade started off with the ongoing Recession of 1969\u201370. Following that, the 1970s energy crisis ensued which included the 1973\u201375 recession, the 1973 oil crisis as well as the 1979 energy crisis beginning as a prelude to a disastrous economic climate injected with stagflation; the combination between high unemployment and high inflation. However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed above the 1,000 mark (1,003.16) for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market. Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the 1973\u20131974 stock market crash; with the situation being exacerbated by the events surrounding the Yom Kippur War. The index closed at 577.60, on December 4, 1974. During 1976, the index went above 1000 several times, and it closed the year at 1,004.75. Although the Vietnam War ended in 1975, new tensions arose towards Iran surrounding the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Other notable disturbances such as the Lebanese Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and the Angolan Civil War which the U.S. and Soviet Union considered critical to the global balance of power, seemed to have had little influence towards the financial markets.

Penalties on Washington's defense helped allow a short McNabb to Brian Westbrook touchdown pass on Philadelphia's opening drive. A fumble by L. J. Smith gave Washington the ball inside Eagle territory, and Jason Campbell capitalized with a touchdown pass to James Thrash, the former Eagle. The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20. The Eagles got the ball back with four minutes to play, and Westbrook immediately took a short pass and broke free for a 57-yard touchdown to go ahead 26-25 (the two-point conversion failing again). The defense came up big again, with Mike Patterson sacking Campbell to jar the ball loose, and Trent Cole recovering. Westbrook carried it in from ten yards out to seal the deal.

Its spiral arms wind in both directions, which makes it nearly impossible for astronomers to determine the rotation of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a galaxy merger with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure. NGC 5253, a peculiar irregular galaxy, is located near the border with Hydra and Messier 83, with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1-2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxys high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus. NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away.

Washington continued an old tradition of playing its arch-rival Cowboys in the first week of the season. Both teams were unimpressive and the Redskins offense sputtered throughout the game, but they finally won 13-10 after a touchdown pass by Tony Romo was nullified after a holding call. They hosted the Texans in Week 2, but good all-around offensive performance (especially by McNabb, who passed for 426 yards and a touchdown) failed to secure a win.

Having already reached the 3,000 hits plateau the previous season, Murray joined Willie Mays and Hank Aaron as the only players ever to have hit at least 500 home runs and amassed 3,000 or more hits in their careers. Rafael Palmeiro,  Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Pujols have since joined the club. He participated in the Orioles playoff run, as the team advanced to the 1996 American League Championship Series against the Yankees after having beat his old team in the ALDS. In nine total postseason games, he went 10-for-30 while hitting one home run.  After being granted free agency by the Orioles, Murray was signed as a free agent by the Los Angeles Angels on December 18, 1996. He played 55 total games in the 1997 season, 46 with the Angels and 9 with the Dodgers. He had a .219 batting average along with 15 RBIs, 3 home runs, and 35 hits.

The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge (Budapest) linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, \u00d3buda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the countrys administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Danube Swabians in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%. Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the \"Jewish Mecca\" or \"Judapest\". In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (Republic of Hungary). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.

The Broncos drove down to near the goal line on their second possession, which was aided by two Bengals' defensive penalties, however, the Broncos were forced to settle for a 20-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. Following a Bengals' fumble on a punt return near midfield, the Broncos took the lead, with quarterback Trevor Siemian connecting on a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. Following an exchange of punts, the Bengals went back ahead, with Hill rushing for his second touchdown from 4 yards out. The Broncos responded, with Siemian throwing another touchdown pass to Sanders from 7 yards out. However, the extra point attempt was blocked. Following a scoreless third quarter, a 34-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent gave the Bengals a 17-16 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos then assembled a 13-play, 82-yard drive, culminating with Siemian firing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Phillips (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt).

From 2010 to 2011, Atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and plateauing income growth at 0.4%. Although unemployment had decreased to 7% by late 2014, this was still higher than the national unemployment rate of 5.8% Atlantas housing market has also struggled, with home prices dropping by 2.1% in January 2012, reaching levels not seen since 1996. Compared with a year earlier, the average home price in Atlanta plummeted to 17.3% in February 2012, thus becoming the largest annual drop in the history of the index for any American or global city. The decline in home prices prompted some economists to deem Atlanta the worst housing market in the nation at the height of the depression.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4. They ended the game with 522 offensive yards, the most since they recorded 542 in a 1989 win against the Lions and the most in a loss since 1940.

The offense got power from Dan Trumble, who led the team with 26 home runs. Outfielder Jason Ellison put together a good season, as he batted .291 with a team leading 19 stolen bases in 130 games. Adam Shabala would post a solid .313 batting average in a span of 70 games.

According to the CIA World Factbook, U.S. income inequality ranked 41st highest among 156 countries in 2017 (i.e., 74% of countries have a more equal income distribution). According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 1% of income households earned about a 9% share of the pre-tax income in 1979, versus 19% in 2007 and 17% in 2014. For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the Great Recession, and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the Affordable Care Act). Recasting the 2012 income using the 1979 income distribution (representing the more egalitarian 1950-1980 period), the bottom 99% of families would have averaged about $7,100 more income. Income inequality in the United States has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas.

On their next possession, the Giants were driving for more, but a tipped ball resulted in an interception inside the red zone. The 49ers responded with a nice drive of their own, aided by a personal foul on linebacker Antonio Pierce and several third down conversions.  San Francisco cashed in with a touchdown from Trent Dilfer to Arnaz Battle. Following a Frank Gore fumble, the Giants took control. The running game, which accounted for 140 total yards helped the Giants move back in front. Brandon Jacobs scored on a five-yard run for a 13-7 lead. After an interception by Sam Madison, the Giants added a 30-yard field goal by Tynes. Tynes made it 19-7 at the half with another field goal, this time from 39 yards, inside the final minute. The Giants defense dominated in the second half, notching six sacks and four total turnovers. Osi Umenyiora put the game away with a sack, forced fumble, and 75-yard touchdown return up the field for a 26-7 lead. The Niners got two points back on a blocked punt out of the end zone but Antonio Pierce redeemed himself for two earlier personal fouls by intercepting Trent Dilfer and returning the ball inside the 10.

The game was played in a driving rainstorm as both teams struggled to move the ball early. With 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Mike Nugent was ready to attempt a 34-yard field goal, but holder Ben Graham could not handle the snap in the slippery conditions, and the Jets were denied. It was the second straight week Graham had flubbed a snap, but this one could be blamed on the wet conditions. The two teams would trade punts for the rest of the half. In the third quarter, Dolphins coach Nick Saban inserted backup quarterback Cleo Lemon into the game, replacing an ineffective Joey Harrington. Finally, the Jets went on a drive with 6:15 left in the third quarter, with Chad Pennington scrambling for 15 yards and moving into the Dolphins' red zone when Yeremiah Bell was flagged for pass interference. Nugent knocked in a 22-yard field goal for the first points of the game. But Lemon rallied Miami, completing two long passes to Randy McMichael and Ronnie Brown picking up a long run before Lemon tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to McMichael, and the Dolphins led 7-3 with 13:26 left in the game. Pennington showed poise in leading the Jets back to take the lead, completing key passes to Brad Smith and Leon Washington before finding Cotchery on a 31-yard completion to the Miami 1-yard line, but the Jets challenged, saying that Cotchery was brought down after he broke the plane of the end zone, and the referee agreed, giving the Jets a 10-7 lead with 8:04 remaining in the game. Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line. Lemon led Miami downfield, completing key passes to Derek Hagan and Sammy Morris before Mare tied the game with a 25-yard field goal. With 2:09 to play, the Jets' biggest play of the season took place. Pennington flipped a short screen pass to Washington, who found a hole and scampered 64 yards down to the Miami 16-yard line.

The Saint Icon was placed above the central beautiful gates of the iconostasis. The new holy altar on the left side of the nave was finished with the assistance of the Franciscan masters at P\u00e9cs in 1946. The design allows the pilgrims to approach the Saint Icon from the courtyard of the church and without disturbing the services in the church. The new pilgrimage church is able to accommodate much larger numbers of pilgrims. Under the guardianship of the Basilian monks, the Saint Shrine has become the most important pilgrimage site in Eastern Hungary. This made the nineteenth-century expansion possible and necessary. In 1856, the church towers were raised one level, and in 1896 the interior of the church was renewed.

In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000\u2013120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353.   While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time.

In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished.

About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%.

Things started off well as the Giants drove right down the field on their opening possession. The balanced, well-executed seven-minute drive was capped off by a 4-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The extra point was missed by Lawrence Tynes. On their next possession, the Giants were driving for more, but a tipped ball resulted in an interception inside the red zone. The 49ers responded with a nice drive of their own, aided by a personal foul on linebacker Antonio Pierce and several third down conversions.  San Francisco cashed in with a touchdown from Trent Dilfer to Arnaz Battle. Following a Frank Gore fumble, the Giants took control. The running game, which accounted for 140 total yards helped the Giants move back in front. Brandon Jacobs scored on a five-yard run for a 13-7 lead. After an interception by Sam Madison, the Giants added a 30-yard field goal by Tynes. Tynes made it 19-7 at the half with another field goal, this time from 39 yards, inside the final minute.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4. They ended the game with 522 offensive yards, the most since they recorded 542 in a 1989 win against the Lions and the most in a loss since 1940.

Students spend three years at preschool, six years of primary education, and four years of secondary school. Tertiary school is not required. An estimated 10.7 percent of the GDP was spend on education in 1999. As of 2013, there are five preschools, four primary schools, three secondary schools, and one tertiary school. The lone college, University of South Pacific, opened in the 1970s via distance courses, and in 1987 a campus was built on the island. It offers accounting, management, primary education, and English studies as majors. Question: How many years do students spend in tertiary school? ",

        "question": "Passage:  In the Patriots' fourth matchup with the Jets in 20 games, head coach Bill Belichick and the Patriots traveled to Giants Stadium to face his former defensive coordinator in Jets head coach Eric Mangini to open the season. The Jets reached Patriots territory on their opening possession, but were forced to punt. The Patriots then began a 12-play, 91-yard drive that ended in an 11-yard Wes Welker touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Kelley Washington forced a fumble on Jets returner Justin Miller after a 26-yard return, but tight end Chris Baker recovered the ball at the Jets' 33-yard line to retain possession. The Jets went three-and-out, but the Patriots punted back to the Jets despite a 19-yard Dont&#233; Stallworth catch to begin their next series. Three plays later, Jets quarterback Chad Pennington was sacked by linebacker Mike Vrabel and defensive lineman Ty Warren, forcing a Jets punt on the final play of the first quarter. Starting from their own 42-yard line after the punt, the Patriots reached the Jets' 25-yard line, where kicker Stephen Gostkowski lined up for a 42-yard field goal attempt. However, the snap was fumbled by holder Matt Cassel, and recovered by Cassel to turn the ball over on downs. The Jets responded with a 10-play, 66-yard drive, tying the game at 7-7 on a 7-yard pass from Pennington to wide receiver Laveranues Coles. Several plays into the Patriots' ensuing drive, before and after the two-minute warning, wide receiver Randy Moss caught passes of 33- and 22-yards from quarterback Tom Brady to put the Patriots in the Jets' red zone. Brady then connected with tight end Benjamin Watson on a 5-yard touchdown pass that was reviewed by the booth but upheld, giving the Patriots a 14-7 lead going into halftime. Patriots cornerback Ellis Hobbs returned the opening kickoff of the second half 108&#160;yards for a touchdown and a new NFL record for the longest kickoff return in the league's history; at the time, it also tied the existing record for longest play in NFL history (a record broken a few weeks later by Antonio Cromartie). Nine plays into the Jets' next drive, Pennington was sacked by defensive lineman Jarvis Green and was injured; Kellen Clemens entered the game but the Jets were forced to punt two plays later. Four plays later, Brady hit Moss for a 51-yard touchdown reception that extended the Patriots' lead to 28-7. However, the Jets came back with a 9-play, 70-yard drive that was capped off with Coles' second touchdown grab of the day, this one from one yard out, to cut the Patriots' lead to 28-14. The Patriots received the ensuing kickoff with just over two minutes remaining in the third quarter and would not surrender the ball until there was just under seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, ending the 17-play drive with a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots' lead to 31-14. The Jets then went three-and-out, and punter Ben Graham's 36-yard punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 47-yard line. On a 1st-and-goal from the Jets' 1-yard line, fullback Heath Evans could not score; the Patriots challenged that the ball did in fact break the plane of the goal line but the play was upheld. On the next play, following the two-minute warning, Evans did in fact score on a 1-yard run, increasing the Patriots' lead to 38-14. The Jets' next drive stalled on a Vrabel strip-sack of Clemens that the Jets recovered, but ended on a failed fourth down conversion from the Jets' 38-yard line. The Patriots then kneeled down once to end the game and give them their first victory of the season as they started 1-0. On September 10, Bill Belichick was accused by the Jets of authorizing his staff to film the Jets' defensive signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated the video camera used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations. On September 13, Belichick was officially fined $500,000, while the Patriots were also fined $250,000, and forfeited their first round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. If the Patriots had missed the playoffs, they would have instead forfeited their second and third round selections in the 2008 draft. Goodell said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick is effectively the team's general manager as well as head coach, and exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick, but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run. Belichick later issued a statement in which he apologized for what he called a \"mistake\" in his interpretation of the rules. However, he denied ever using videotape to gain an advantage while a game was underway. Question: How many yards longer was the Patriots first scoring drive compared to the Jets first scoring drive?

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 1% of income households earned about a 9% share of the pre-tax income in 1979, versus 19% in 2007 and 17% in 2014. For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the Great Recession, and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the Affordable Care Act). Recasting the 2012 income using the 1979 income distribution (representing the more egalitarian 1950-1980 period), the bottom 99% of families would have averaged about $7,100 more income.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties.

Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen.

The game was played in a driving rainstorm as both teams struggled to move the ball early. With 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Mike Nugent was ready to attempt a 34-yard field goal, but holder Ben Graham could not handle the snap in the slippery conditions, and the Jets were denied. It was the second straight week Graham had flubbed a snap, but this one could be blamed on the wet conditions. The two teams would trade punts for the rest of the half. In the third quarter, Dolphins coach Nick Saban inserted backup quarterback Cleo Lemon into the game, replacing an ineffective Joey Harrington. Finally, the Jets went on a drive with 6:15 left in the third quarter, with Chad Pennington scrambling for 15 yards and moving into the Dolphins' red zone when Yeremiah Bell was flagged for pass interference. Nugent knocked in a 22-yard field goal for the first points of the game. But Lemon rallied Miami, completing two long passes to Randy McMichael and Ronnie Brown picking up a long run before Lemon tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to McMichael, and the Dolphins led 7-3 with 13:26 left in the game. Pennington showed poise in leading the Jets back to take the lead, completing key passes to Brad Smith and Leon Washington before finding Cotchery on a 31-yard completion to the Miami 1-yard line, but the Jets challenged, saying that Cotchery was brought down after he broke the plane of the end zone, and the referee agreed, giving the Jets a 10-7 lead with 8:04 remaining in the game. Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line.

His quatrains (jueju) describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line.

Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712-770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it.

All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%. The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987 and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget. The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. This was the slowest rate of growth in inflation adjusted spending since Eisenhower. However, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration. As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the worlds largest international creditor to the worlds largest debtor nation. Reagan described the new debt as the \"greatest disappointment\" of his presidency.

The earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the Yangtze River, is carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago. Farming gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC). At Damaidi in Ningxia, 3,172 Neolithic signs in China dating to 6000\u20135000 BC have been discovered, \"featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing\". These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC, Dadiwan culture from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC. Some scholars have suggested that Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BC) were the earliest Chinese writing system. Excavation of a Peiligang culture site in Xinzheng county, Henan, found a community that flourished in 5,500 to 4,900 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead. With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators.

The game was played in a driving rainstorm as both teams struggled to move the ball early. With 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Mike Nugent was ready to attempt a 34-yard field goal, but holder Ben Graham could not handle the snap in the slippery conditions, and the Jets were denied. It was the second straight week Graham had flubbed a snap, but this one could be blamed on the wet conditions. The two teams would trade punts for the rest of the half. In the third quarter, Dolphins coach Nick Saban inserted backup quarterback Cleo Lemon into the game, replacing an ineffective Joey Harrington. Finally, the Jets went on a drive with 6:15 left in the third quarter, with Chad Pennington scrambling for 15 yards and moving into the Dolphins' red zone when Yeremiah Bell was flagged for pass interference. Nugent knocked in a 22-yard field goal for the first points of the game. But Lemon rallied Miami, completing two long passes to Randy McMichael and Ronnie Brown picking up a long run before Lemon tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to McMichael, and the Dolphins led 7-3 with 13:26 left in the game. Pennington showed poise in leading the Jets back to take the lead, completing key passes to Brad Smith and Leon Washington before finding Cotchery on a 31-yard completion to the Miami 1-yard line, but the Jets challenged, saying that Cotchery was brought down after he broke the plane of the end zone, and the referee agreed, giving the Jets a 10-7 lead with 8:04 remaining in the game. Miami was then forced to punt, but caught a break when Donnie Jones' kick bounced off the elbow of Jets linebacker Brad Kassell, and long snapper John Denney recovered at the Jets' 42-yard line. Lemon led Miami downfield, completing key passes to Derek Hagan and Sammy Morris before Mare tied the game with a 25-yard field goal. With 2:09 to play, the Jets' biggest play of the season took place. Pennington flipped a short screen pass to Washington, who found a hole and scampered 64 yards down to the Miami 16-yard line.

Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008; she announced her retirement October 8, 2010 on the shows website, effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings. Her last episode as producer, which aired January 27, 2011, featured a theme in tribute to her. The shows official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode. Frank Wayne, a Goodson-Todman staffer since the 1950s, was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show. Barker assumed that role after Waynes death in March 1988, as previously stated. Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert, Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi (Waynes son). Michael Dimich assumed the directors chair in June 2011. Marc Breslow, Paul Alter, Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director. Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten, as well as technical director Glenn Koch, have directed episodes strictly on a fill-in basis. Sandler began directing episodes in 2012, and became the official director in 2013. Aside from Barker, the shows production staff remained intact after Carey became host. FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the programs new executive producer, with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitzs departure. Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007, before Carey was ultimately chosen. Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009-10 season started, with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010. Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show. Question: How many years was Roger Dobkowitz the producer? ",

The rivalry is fueled by the quarterback comparison between Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. The Patriots owned the beginning of the series, defeating the Colts in six consecutive contests including the 2003 AFC Championship game and a 2004 AFC Divisional game. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. On November 4, 2007 the Patriots defeated the Colts 24-20; in the next matchup on November 2, 2008, the Colts won 18-15 in a game that was one of the reasons the Patriots failed to make the playoffs; in the 2009 meeting, the Colts staged a spirited comeback to beat the Patriots 35-34; in 2010 New England Patriots season the Colts almost staged another comeback, pulling within 31-28 after trailing 31-14 in the fourth quarter, but fell short due to a Patriots interception of a Manning pass late in the game; it turned out to be Mannings final meeting against the Patriots as a member of the Colts.  After a 2011 Indianapolis Colts season that included a 31-24 loss to the Patriots, the Colts drafted Andrew Luck and in November of 2012 Indianapolis Colts season the two teams met with identical 6-3 records; the Patriots erased a 14-7 gap to win 59-24.

One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Irans telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2/3 from \"voice\" mobile-phone and 1/10 from \"data\" mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business.

With two games against opponents with losing records approaching, it was crucial for the Giants to escape this one with a win. The Eagles started things off right away, putting 14 points on the board before the Giants had run their fifth play from scrimmage. McNabb connected with Celek for a touchdown, and Sheldon Brown returned a Brandon Jacobs fumble for six points on the ensuing drive. In the second quarter, Nicks caught the longest reception of his short career for a 68-yard touchdown. After DeSean Jackson responded by returning a Jeff Feagles punt 72 yards for a touchdown, the Giants were able to send Bradshaw into the end zone from the 3. Eagles backup quarterback Michael Vick was able to sneak in one more rushing touchdown before halftime. Jacobs opened the scoring in the second half with a 1-yard rush. After the teams traded turnovers, Manning got the ball into Hixon's hands for a 61-yard touchdown. But the Eagles responded on the very next play with a 60-yard touchdown to Jackson. Jackson's 176 receiving yards amounted to the best individual receiving performance against the Giants since 2002. The Eagles struck again in the fourth quarter, this time on a run by fullback Leonard Weaver and a two-point conversion pass to Jason Avant. The Giants put another touchdown on the board (courtesy of Boss) in the last two minutes of the game, and got the ball back with 28 seconds left. But defensive end Darren Howard sacked Manning and forced a fumble, sealing the Eagles' first sweep of the Giants since 2004. The Eagles scored 85 points against the Giants this year, the most they have scored versus the Giants in a single season in franchise history. The Eagles have improved to 9-4 with many hopes of making it into the playoffs. Question: How many yards did DeSean Jackson have on touchdowns? ",
